<p>Previously, Intel launched 11th Gen processors that are all way down to i7-11700T because the i9-11900K comes with 16 threads and eight cores. You might be looking for a place where you Buy i9-11900k without facing the issue.</p>



<p>Short answer &#8211; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08X6PPTTH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B08X6PPTTH&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=technoburst-01-20&amp;linkId=a0c1e88f8c4bf013d522d06e79361333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Intel&#8217;s top-of-the-line had a hard time over the last year, first defending itself against the Ryzen 3000 and then the Ryzen 5000 with significant improvements in their performance per cycle because of AMD&#8217;s Zen3 architecture.</p>



<p>The Intel Core i9-11900K is finally in a reality, and it is the great competitor of the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, both in terms of performance and price, and Intel needs to get an excellent product to be able to beat an AMD that does not stop evolving.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-it"><strong>What’s new in it? </strong></h2>



<a target="_blank" class="alignright" href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08X6PPTTH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B08X6PPTTH&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=canadiansto01-20&amp;linkId=1b81e63b8350060e0026a293a2134e16" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright" border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=CA&amp;ASIN=B08X6PPTTH&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=canadiansto01-20"></a><p>The Intel Core i9 11900K uses eight Sunny Cove cores and a Xe Gen 12 GPU. These changes translate into an IPC improvement of up to 19% at the CPU level compared to Comet Lake-S and up to 50% performance at the GPU level versus the generation used in Gen9.5. As if this were not enough, Intel has tuned the operating frequencies to the maximum and adjusted level through the turbo mode.</p>



<p>The Intel Core i9 11900K maintains the monolithic core design that we have seen in previous generations, which means that all cores and elements of the processor, are integrated into a single chip. So, if you wish to <strong>Buy i9-11900k</strong> from the UK or the USA, then choose the right retailer first.</p>



<p>The Intel Core i9 11900K uses more advanced architecture at the CPU and integrated GPU level. A higher IPC means that a processor will perform more than another with a lower IPC, although both have the same working frequency and the same number of cores.</p>



<h2 id="h-specification-of-i9-11900k"><strong>Specification of i9-11900k</strong></h2>



<ol><li>Cypress Cove architecture in 14 nm +++ process.</li><li>Eight cores and sixteen threads at 3.5 GHz-5.3 GHz, regular and turbo mode</li><li>Unlocked multiplier (supports overclocking).</li><li>GPU Intel UHD Graphics 750 (Xe Gen12).</li><li>125-watt TDP (PL1).</li><li>16MB L3 cache.</li><li>Compatible with LGA 1200 socket and H470 and Z490 chipset, and with 500 series</li></ol>



<h2 id="h-release-date"><strong>Release Date:</strong></h2>



<p>Intel recently launched i9-11900k on March 30, 2021, which was an extensive collaboration of intel. Still, there is confusion about the actual release date because many retailers sell out i9-11900K about 3 to 4 weeks before its official launching date. So, if you want to <strong>buy i9-11900K,</strong> contact the nearest retailer.</p>

<p>Today, many have been hoping that a new battle will unfold in the desktop processor market. After all, Intel lost the past-release AMD Ryzen and built on the Zen 3 microarchitecture and beat all the trump cards of the Core processors.</p>



<p>The main differences between the new and the previous model were apparent and were mainly in the improvements of performance per cycle (IPC) and the connective capacity. The changes between generations are also the same, with more PCI Express lanes, faster, more capable, and modern graphics.</p>



<p>Intel i9-11900k even have similar operating frequencies and the same turbo features available that include Intel&#8217;s Turbo Boost 3.0 technology in addition to TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) technology that makes both models have a maximum turbo speed for a few cores, up to 5.3GHz.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-is-it-better-than-the-previous-ones"><strong>How is it better than the previous ones?</strong></h2>



<p>The Intel Core i9 11900K can peak at almost 5.3 GHz with a single active core. This explains the victory over the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X in CPU-Z and Cinebench R23 in single-threaded performance. However, as more cores and threads are brought into operation, their frequency is gradually reduced until it is in the following bands:</p>



<ol><li>One active core: up to 5.3 GHz.</li><li>Four cores and eight threads: up to 5.1 GHz.</li><li>Six cores and twelve threads: up to 5.05 GHz.</li><li>Eight cores and sixteen threads: up to 4.76 GHz.</li></ol>



<h2 id="h-the-i9-11900k-price-in-market"><strong>The i9-11900K price in market:</strong></h2>



<p>The suggested retail price of Intel core i9-11900K is $539 that is about $710, and £390. This intel chip is the competitor of the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X and comes with incredible features. However, due to high demand,<strong> the real price is about $900</strong>.</p>

And the best thing is that it is still very inexpensive. This amazing 6.39-inches phone is more built for mobile gaming because it runs on the Android v10.0 operating system and powered by the Snapdragon 845 with 6GB RAM + 128GB storage, which is enough for every user. You will surely enjoy a higher framerate while playing even the most resource-heavy games like PUBG Mobile and Call of Duty, all with lower heat production and power consumption.</p>

<p>Enjoy the incredible power of the latest generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 that gives you satisfaction for your mobile gaming experience. It is complete with 4GB RAM and 128GB of internal storage upgraded up to 400GB. There is also a Nokia 7.1, the predecessor of the 7.2, which is also excellent in terms of mobile gaming performance and it is a lot cheaper than the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-7-2-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile/dp/B07XVZXR5Y?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Nokia+7.2&amp;qid=1618573125&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=technoburst-01-20&amp;linkId=7767c26ad5e7363279976252619084fd&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank">Nokia 7.2</a>. However, the Nokia 7.1 is a little outdated, and you will not probably want to play popular mobile games on low settings. That’s why I recommend Nokia 7.2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Perhaps one of the best combinations, for a <a href="/ryzen-7-5800x-radeon-rx-6800-xt-gaming-build-under-2200/">pure-gaming PC build</a>, is AMD’s Ryzen 5 5600X CPU together with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti. These two components can offer excellent 1080p gaming with high framerates at just a fraction of the cost of what such performance used to be valued just a few months ago.</p>



<p>Given that the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti has only a 200-Watt Thermal Design Power (TDP) requirement, and Ryzen 5 5600X’s 65 W TDP, a Power Supply Unit (PSU) capable of outputting 650 Watts will work just fine for providing energy to a build that features these two components. In fact, one may argue that 650 W may be a bit too much, but its always better to have more power output capability, rather than less, as a PSU will operate at optimal efficiency at around 50% loads.</p>



<p>Hence why we’ve chosen the best 650 Watt PSUs for you to pair with the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and Ryzen 5 5600X, depending on your needs and preferences.</p>

<p>Whether you’ve appropriated most of your budget for this new CPU and GPU pairing, or simply won’t be using your PC for several hours a day, an 80 PLUS Bronze rated PSU will suit your needs perfectly well. For this case, we have the Gigabyte P650B which has all the specifications of a premium PSU, at a budget price.</p>



<p>Firstly, it has a single +12V rail that can output nearly all of its wattage: 648 W (54 amps) to be precise, so both the R5 5600X and the RTX 3060 Ti will have sufficient energy to operate optimally. The P650B also has all-Japanese Nippon Chemi-Con, 105 degree C certified capacitors, sleeved cables (non-modular), and a 120 mm fan that uses high-end hydraulic bearings. Having these bearings not only means that the PSU is more durable, but also that it will operate quietly, no matter what the load it is under. In fact, the P650B has a Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of 100,000 hours, and this is backed by Gigabyte’s 3-year warranty.</p>



<p>The Gigabyte P650 can currently be found for only $69.99, down slightly from its original $74.99 MSRP.</p>

<p>If you want your PC to not just be a mechanical wonder, but also a splendiferous illuminated centerpiece for your room or office, then you will need a PSU that can match the RGB flare of your other hardware components.</p>



<p>For this case, we have the Super Flower Leadex III. This power supply has an 80 PLUS Gold rating (translating to an efficiency level of 87% to 90%) and a high power +12V rail that can output 649.2 watts, or 54.1 amps. Like the aforementioned Gigabyte model, it also has 105-degree Celsius certified Japanese capacitors, and the power supply has been tested to not falter even after 2,000 on/off switches.</p>



<p>The Leadex III is cooled by a 130 mm fan that makes use of contactless hydro-dynamic bearings and PWM controls, so temperatures and noise levels will be low no matter how busy the PSU is. Also note, the Leadex III is fully modular, so all cables can be removed and attached according to your needs.</p>



<p>Lest we forget, the Leadex III has two ARGB displays: A illuminated I/O crystal-designed panel and an ARGB illuminated fan with translucent blades. These RGB displays can be synchronized using any motherboard manufacturer synchronization software.</p>



<p>Of course, style does come at a cost, but for what the Leadex III has to offer, it fully justifies its $159.99 price tag – which is backed by a 7-year warranty.</p>

<p>The Ryzen 5 5600X and the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti would make an excellent pairing for a Small Form Factor (SFF) PC, and for such a build they will need an SFX form factor PSU.</p>



<p>Seasonic’s FOCUS SGX-650 offers amazing performance and versatility in a small form factor – and a very reasonable price.</p>



<p>Firstly, it has a single +12V rail that can output 54 Amps (or 648 Watts) with an 80 Plus Gold certification; similar to the Leadex III. Also, it includes a 120 mm fan (which is huge for a SFX PSU) that makes use of premium fluid dynamic fan bearings, for low noise use and optimal durability, as well as PWM controls. The SGX-650 also has gold plated connecters, a cable-free internal connection design, a SFX to ATX bracket (for those that need a small PSU for a full ATX case), un-sleeved cables for better flexibility (fully modular), and a MTBF of 100,000 hours that is backed by an impressive 10-year warranty.</p>

<p>Building a <a href="/ryzen-7-5800x-radeon-rx-6800-xt-gaming-build-under-2200/">PC for mid-range gaming</a>, streaming, and <a href="/ryzen-9-5900x-amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-build-under-3000/">content creation</a> means having a powerful CPU that can muster both single-core and multi-core performance, and a GPU that can handle 1440p 144 Hz and 4K 60 FPS gaming, as well as editing software like Premiere or DaVinci Resolve, After Effects, and Photoshop.</p>



<p>The two components that fill these specifications perfectly, are the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X CPU, and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070. This CPU holds a respectable number of cores and threads (8/16), together with AMD’s new Zen 3 CCX architecture, so it can handle both gaming and content creation. Also, unlike AMD’s new series of Radeon RX 6000 series graphics cards, the GeForce RTX 3070 has respectably high <a href="https://scontent.fath3-4.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/131292031_387942045799827_5906331562988643627_n.png?_nc_cat=103&amp;ccb=2&amp;_nc_sid=ae9488&amp;_nc_eui2=AeHEOywJBLIPAi23M-WXDmcWRs_OEmwVzxBGz84SbBXPEK22yafIlVDQNxjDW_eleCq2nOqMz42BjQZc44NSnfQg&amp;_nc_ohc=rrieyUnzrXMAX_RtmnM&amp;_nc_oc=AQlPPYCvdST_1nIP_AYl4UkJCFVSgDBm2yxh4kvYddAQ7D7qFEkbT4Mof7zT7XPgcEk&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fath3-4.fna&amp;oh=8bc83d1f441818d5e46e4d1c8079e9af&amp;oe=60350FEF" rel="nofollow">editing benchmarks</a>, so together they can make a great all-around hybrid build.</p>



<p>To power these components, you will need a power supply of equally high quality. The GeForce RTX 3070 requires 220 watts of power to operate, and the Ryzen 7 5800X requires 105 watts, so a PSU of 750 watts will suit the build perfectly; keeping the loads at around 50-75%, where efficiency levels are best.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some of the best options available in the market, for different requirements and preferences.</p>

<p>Both the GeForce RTX 3070 and the Ryzen 7 5800X are quite expensive, costing almost a thousand dollars combined – and that’s if you find them at their MSRP – so, if you’re looking for supplementary components to be as cheap as possible, we recommend the Cooler Master Watt 750.</p>



<p>This power supply has an 80 PLUS Bronze rating certification, meaning it has an efficiency level ranging 82% to 85%; which is satisfactory if you don’t plan on using your PC for too many hours and on a daily basis.</p>



<p>Despite its lower price tag, the Watt 750 has a single +12V rail that can output its full 750 W (54.1 amps) potential, which means you don’t need to worry about having enough power supplied to your CPU or GPU.</p>



<p>In terms of its thermal solution, the Watt 750 uses a PWM controlled 120 mm Corsair Silencio FP fan, which includes Loop Dynamic Bearings and IP6X dustproof certification, which Cooler Master claims reduce vibrations, noise, and increases the life expectancy of the fan to up to 160,000 hours.</p>



<p>But the best aspect of the Watt 750 is its price, as you can currently find this semi-modular PSU for just $84.99 – down from its original $94.99 MSRP.</p>

<p>If you plan on having your PC setup also be a centerpiece for your desk, room, or office, then the more components you can find with an RGB flare, the better, and that includes the power supply. Luckily enough, Super Flower has you covered with their Flower Leadex III.</p>



<p>This PSU has not one, but two ARGB illuminated displays: a crystal connector panel design opposite the back I/O ports, and a 130 mm ARGB illuminated fan with translucent blades and premium fluid dynamic bearings. This fan is also PWM controlled, so temperatures and noise levels will be kept at an absolute minimum.</p>



<p>But the Leadex III is not just all about looks. It has an 80 PLUS Gold rating, which guarantees efficiency levels ranging from 87 to 90%, a fully modular cable design, a single high power +12V rail that can output 748.8 W (62.4 A), and all-Japanese 105-degree certified capacitors. It has been tested for over 2,000 on/off switches, and even includes an impressive 10-year warranty with free shipping for any potential exchange.</p>



<p>The Super Flower Leadex III might be a bit expensive, but for what it offers it is worth every dollar. You can currently find it for $178.99.</p>

<p>For those looking to make a small, yet powerful, Small Form Factor (SFF) PC with the Ryzen 7 5800X and the GeForce RTX 3070, you will need an equally powerful SFX PSU with a high energy efficiency level; to prevent the PSU from transferring heat to the other tight-fit components that are prone to thermal issues. The best power supply for the task is the Corsair SF750.</p>



<p>This fully modular PSU has an 80 PLUS Platinum certification (90%+ efficiency), a single +12V rail that can output 750 W (62.5 A), a PWM controlled 92 mm fan that will only operate at loads above 40%, individually sleeved cables with flexible paracord sleeves, an SFX to ATX bracket (for those that need a small PSU for an ATX build), a Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of 100,000 hours, and a 7-year warranty.</p>



<p>The Corsair SF750 has an MSRP of $184.99, but the price does fluctuate according to availability.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we have an option for those that seek to build a silent PC, devoid of any low-frequency humming or monotonous droning sounds: The be quiet! Straight Power 11 750 W.</p>



<p>This PSU includes a 135 mm fan made with being quiet!’s Silent Wings 3 design, high-end fluid dynamic bearings, a 6-pole fan motor, and static pressure optimized fan blades. This translates to noise levels that range from 8.6 to 20.8 decibels – which is ultimately inaudible from a foot away.</p>



<p>Like the aforementioned SF750, this power supply is also 80 PLUS Platinum rated, but it is different in that it has multiple high power +12V rails – four to be exact. These rails, though independent from each other, are separated into two pairs: one pair outputting 20 amps, and the other pair outputs 24 amps for a total of 84 amps, or 820 watts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the capacitors within are 105-degree Celsius certified and Japanese manufactured, all its cables are fully sleeved (fully modular), and the internal components are wire-free, so thermals will always be low.</p>



<p>You can find the be quiet! Straight Power 11 750 W PSU currently for $169.99, which is a great deal for the performance and value this silent power supply offers.</p>

<p>Finding and purchasing a GPU for a new PC build may seem like a simple task, but the new generation of graphical processors, both from Nvidia and AMD, have seen releases plagued by low stock counts and scalper bots; ultimately resulting in a barren current-generation GPU market.</p>



<p>The only oasis in this destitute marketplace are prebuilt PCs, since these vendors have secured a number of GPUs units from the manufacturers prior to their release. Of course, prebuilt PCs do have a bad name for themselves, as many times components that are not as marketable as the CPU or GPU will end up being of lower quality; in-turn throttling the performance of the overall setup.</p>



<p>However, as is the case with most products, outliers do exist, that maintain consistent quality throughout all their internal hardware. Such prebuilt cases have solid power supplies, high-speed RAM, and proper CPU variants.</p>



<p>Still, it must be mentioned that there inevitably will be components that may need upgrading, or switching – which, in best-case scenarios, will have to do with the cooling solution. Also, specific GPU aftermarket models, as well as motherboard models, will be undisclosed by prebuilt PC vendors, as they only use what they have available at the time of purchase.</p>



<p>If you are okay with the inherent downsides of prebuilt PCs, there are some great options to choose from, two of the best of which we have listed below.</p>

<p>If you prefer to play games at higher resolutions, like 1440p or 4K, then AMD’s Zen 2 CPUs will work just fine for your setup, as the processing load will fall mainly onto the GPU; which is where the GeForce RTX 3070 will carry the setup. This way, not only can you find a far cheaper prebuilt PC, but it will also have better internal components than other competing Intel options.</p>



<p>The Skytech Chronos comes with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X CPU which has eight cores, 16 threads, a 32 MB L3 cache, and a base clock frequency of 3.6 GHz. It also includes a stock Wraith Prism CPU cooler which provides sufficient cooling for the Ryzen 7 3700X that generally runs at low temperatures – and has a Thermal Design Power (TDP) of just 65W.</p>



<p>This CPU will be situated onto a B550 m-ATX motherboard, which is usually meant for mini-towers that have a smaller footprint. Though the specific included B550 model is undisclosed and will vary in accordance with availability, many users report the PC coming with an ASRock B550M/AC motherboard: not great, but not a dealbreaker either.</p>



<p>Also included is an ADATA SX6000LNP 1 TB NVMe M.2 SSD, and 16 GB of 3,600 MHz DDR4 RAM – most likely to be XPG’s GAMMIX D30 CL18 memory. A CAS of 16 cycles would be optimal at the 3,600 MHz frequency, but the memory can always be overclocked or expanded. Finally, a 650W 80 PLUS Gold certified Power Supply Unit (PSU) will provide wattage to the internal components: a solid option for a gaming PSU.</p>



<p>All this hardware will be situated into a Skytech Chronos White Edition Gaming Case, which includes a clear-glass side panel, a front I/O panel that has two audio jacks, two USB 2.0, one USB 3.0, and LED on/off switches, a top dust filter, and a featured mesh. This case will also include four ARGB dual ring case-fans (most likely to be 120 mm in diameter), so the cooling does appear to be sufficient for the overall setup. In conclusion, a stylish case with respectable hardware to accompany the coveted GeForce RTX 3070 GPU.</p>



<p>The Skytech Chronos can currently be found for $1,749 – which is about $1,000 cheaper than its competitors’ prebuilt Intel desktop PCs.</p>

<p>When it comes to prebuilt PCs featuring Intel processors, there are certain traps that a buyer must be wary of, in order to avoid disappointment. Firstly, Intel does offer variations of their higher-end CPUs that have vastly reduced clock speeds, in order to lower their TDP (meant mainly for business-oriented, or workstation, computers). For example, the i9-10900F – which can be found in many prebuilt PCs, mainly by Computer Upgrade King (CUK) – has a base clock frequency of only 2.8 GHz (and a TDP of 65W) in comparison to the 3.7 GHz base clock frequency of the i9-10900K with its 125W TDP.</p>



<p>Additionally, RAM can throttle a CPU’s performance significantly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbHyF50m-rs">Gamer’s Nexus</a> has proven that an i5-10600K can outperform a i9-10900K, based purely on the RAM it’s paired with. Therefore, purchasing a high-end CPU with 2,666 MHz or 2,933 MHz RAM will simply throttle its performance.</p>



<p>The OMEN 30L avoids both these shady practices, as it comes equipped with an Intel i7-10700KF CPU with eight cores, 16 threads, a base clock frequency of 3.8 GHz, and a max turbo frequency of 5.10 GHz. Note, this CPU has a high TDP of 125W, so the 120 mm liquid AIO cooling unit may need to be replaced for something a bit more powerful. Additionally, the OMEN 30L comes equipped with HyperX 16 GB DDR4 3,200 MHz RAM which can be expanded to 64 GB. This is likely to be a 3,200 MHz CL16 model, which may not be as optimal as a CAS of 14 cycles, but it can be overclocked for a performance boost.</p>



<p>The OMEN 30L also includes a 1 TB NVMe M.2 SSD, which will likely to be a Western Digital Black.</p>



<p>What’s strikingly great for a prebuilt PC, is the 750W 80 PLUS Platinum PSU, that allows for incredibly high energy efficiency that is otherwise absent from prebuilt PCs. This translates not just to less energy expenditure, but also less heat that is dissipated into the case.</p>



<p>All in all, the only upgrades recommended would be an additional rank of RAM (dual channel memory is mostly superior to single channel setups) and, certainly, a better CPU cooler.</p>



<p>For what the prebuilt PC market has to offer, there are few, if any, PCs that rival the OMEN 30L, which can be currently found for $2,799.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult GPUs to come by, despite having been launched over three months ago, is Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080. The first batch of this GPU was sold-out within a matter of minutes – to the delight of scalpers that had their scripts ready for the initial launch. The releases that followed were still inadequate for the level of demand that still lingers, and AMD is facing the same difficulties in pushing out their new Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>If we’re to take into account that certain units of the GeForce RTX 3080 are still being sold for outrageous prices – that reach from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Dominator-Platinum-Airflow-CMDAF2/dp/B077455184/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Memory+Fan+Cooling&amp;sr=8-3&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=technoburst-01-20&amp;linkId=ef18b2e7acf6a2c3eafb127b1c9341d2&amp;language=en_US" rel="nofollow">$1,547</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Graphics-DisplayPort-Axial-tech-2-9-Slot/dp/B08J6GMWCQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;keywords=rtx+3080&amp;qid=1610569792&amp;sr=8-6&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=technoburst-01-20&amp;linkId=cfb49ba597a701d05e662d723d616664&amp;language=en_US" rel="nofollow">$2,523</a> – seeking better alternatives has become a necessity. One such alternative is purchasing a pre-built PC.</p>



<p>Pre-built desktop computers have made a bad name for themselves, mostly due to the fact that they have a mixed variety of components, quality-wise. They may have killer CPUs and GPUs, but terrible power supplies or cooling. That is why, even when seeking a pre-built PC solely for the fact that they include a much sought-out and unavailable GPU, caution must be given in purchasing the right setup that will require the least number of necessary replacements.</p>



<p>To help you in such an endeavor, we’ve chosen the two best pre-built PCs featuring the GeForce RTX 3080; for their price and overall components.</p>

<p>If you want a PC for more than just gaming, and would like to have the option to also stream or create content, like edit photos and produce videos, then you will need a CPU with powerful multi-core performance. This is why we have chosen the Skytech Chronos, which comes with an AMD Ryzen 9 PRO 3900 CPU that features 12 cores and 24 threads. The difference of this Ryzen 9 variant with the more popular Ryzen 9 3900X, is that it has slightly less base and max boost clock speeds (3.1 GHz and 4.3 GHz versus 3.8 and 4.6 GHz) together with a far lower TDP (65 W vs 105 W), which is preferable for workstations. Of course, this CPU is part of the previous generation of AMD processors, so it will not fare well at lower, 1080p, resolutions. However, if you plan on using your PC for 4K gaming, the Ryzen 9 PRO 3900 will work just as well as any 10<sup>th</sup> generation Intel CPU, as higher resolutions place processing load falls mainly onto the GPU – which is where the GeForce RTX 3080 shines.</p>



<p>The aftermarket model of the GeForce RTX 3080, as well as the included X570 motherboard, are undisclosed; since they will vary depending on what’s available.</p>



<p>As additional featured hardware, the Skytech Chronos has a solid 850 Watt 80 PLUS Gold certified PSU, 16 GB of 3,600 MHz CL18 G.Skill Trident Z RAM (two ranks of 8 GB), and – surprisingly enough – a powerful PCIe Gen-4 M.2 NVMe SSD: namely the Seagate FireCuda 520. The PSU and the NVMe SSD (for the operating system) will suffice, but the RAM may need to be overclocked in order to produce the proper speeds needed to unlock the full potential of the other internal components. A 3,600 MHz C16 RAM would be recommended if you wish to upgrade the included kit.</p>



<p>Cooling wise, we have an AIO liquid CPU cooler with a 360 mm radiator, as well as four ARGB dual ring 120 mm fans – though three of these four fans are used to cool the radiator of the CPU cooler, so a few additional case-fans may be needed in order to maintain sufficient airflow.</p>



<p>The Skytech Chronos can currently be purchased for $2,549.99; which is a respectable price for a pre-built desktop that includes a GeForce RTX 3080 and will only require some minor updates to be a top of the line setup. For those looking to game at high resolutions and/or stream and create content from the PC, this is the build to go for.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table Specs table table-hover"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Brand</strong></td><td>Omen</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics Coprocessor</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080</td></tr><tr><td><strong><strong>Operating System</strong></strong></td><td>Windows 10 Home</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU Model</strong></td><td>Core i9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hard Disk Description</strong></td><td>SSHD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>For gaming purists and competitors, the Omen 30L offers both the coveted Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, as well as a 10<sup>th</sup> generation Intel Core i9-10850K CPU that guarantees optimally high framerates, no matter what the resolution of graphical processing. This CPU is almost identical to the i9-10900K, yet differs in that it has slightly less base and boosts clock speeds by 100 MHz.</p>



<p>The Omen 30L cools the i9-10850K via the use of a 120 mm AIO liquid cooler; which will surely need to be replaced at some point, as it will be insufficient in keeping this high-end Intel CPU from reaching suboptimal temperatures. This is also the case with its overall thermal solution, as it includes only two small case-fans (one 120 mm front, one 92 mm back).</p>



<p>Storage wise, we have a 1 TB NVMe M.2 Western Digital Black SSD, which is a solid option as far as PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSDs go (Intel CPUs do not currently support PCIe 4.0). It also includes 2 TB of 7,200 RPM SATA HDD storage, which may seem outdated, but will certainly come in handy for storing data that does not need to be readily processed.</p>



<p>For RAM, the Omen 30L includes 32 GB of HyperX 3,200 MHz memory in two modules (can be expanded to four), though it is unclear what the latency of the RAM is. If it has a CAS of 14, that would be optimal.</p>



<p>Finally, the Omen 30L includes an incredible 750 W 80 PLUS Platinum PSU, which is quite rare for a pre-built PC. The wattage is on the slightly lower side, but if you don’t plan on overclocking the CPU to its extreme, it should handle the build just fine.</p>



<p>All in all, the Omen 30L is one of the best pre-built PC choices, as the only components that will need to be replaced have to do with cooling. A couple of extra case fans and a decent CPU cooler will work wonders here, and make the Omen 30L a high-end setup for gaming and beyond.</p>



<p>The Omen 30L can currently be purchased for $2,994.90.</p>

<p>Getting your hands on a new Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 ranges from difficult, to almost impossible; seeing as how quickly this GPU sold-out and how little initial stock Nvidia offered. Of course, this issue is only exacerbated by the number of scalpers that purchased both Nvidia and AMD’s newly released GPUs, in order to resell them at higher prices and make a quick profit.</p>



<p>An alternative to making these scalpers gleeful, by purchasing their vastly overpriced GPUs, is finding a solid pre-built PC that you can use, and later customize as you see fit. Currently, there are two such options that include the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 at a reasonable price for the peripheral hardware components they include.</p>



<p>In this article, we will analyze both <a href="/category/builds/">PC builds</a>, and see whether or not they are worth their asking price.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table Specs table table-hover"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Brand</strong></td><td>Computer Upgrade King</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics Coprocessor</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090</td></tr><tr><td><strong><strong>Operating System</strong></strong></td><td>Windows 10 Home</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU Model</strong></td><td>Core i9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hardware Interface</strong></td><td>USB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Though a bit costly, Computer Upgrade King (CUK) has two pre-built PCs that feature the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 GPU and the Intel i9-10900 Series CPU. In fact, this CPU is the i9-10900KF series, which is almost identical to the i9-10900K variant but does not come with an integrated Intel UHD Graphics 630 graphical processor – making it cost slightly less. The i9-10900K(F) includes 10 cores, 20 threads, a base clock speed of 3.7 GHz, and a boost clock speed of 5.3 GHz.</p>



<p>The difference between the two CUK pre-built PCs, is that one has 64 GB of RAM, 1 TB NVMe SSD, and a 2 TB HDD, while the other has a total of 2 TB of NVMe SSD storage, 4 TB of HDD storage, and 128 GB of RAM.</p>



<p>The model of the GeForce RTX 3090 and the Z490 motherboard are not disclosed, as they will vary depending on availability. The PC does come with an 850 Watt 80 PLUS Gold certified PSU, a gaming keyboard and mouse, five ARGB cooling case-fans (three front, two top, and one rear), and a liquid AIO CPU cooler – the radiator size of which is unknown.</p>



<p>One major downside to this pre-built computer is the RAM. Both the 64 GB and the 128 GB versions of this PC use 2,933 MHz RAM, which will certainly throttle the capabilities of the Intel i9-10900KF. In fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbHyF50m-rs" rel="nofollow">Gamer’s Nexus</a> has proven that without the proper RAM, the Intel i9-10900K(F) can be outperformed even by the much cheaper i5-10600K. The RAM is a component that will definitely need to be replaced, at least in the long run.</p>



<p>The case has a stylish ARGB display in the front, and a tempered-glass side panel that swings open for easy access to the interior.</p>



<p>Though most components within the CUK Continuum are unknown, the fact that it has a solid case, CPU, and GPU, means that it can always be further customized down the line. Of course, these components do come at a hefty price of $4,049.99 (for the 64 GB of RAM and 3 TB of storage) and $4,399.99 (for the 128 GB of RAM and 6 TB of storage) – but, once again, we would recommend the cheaper option, as the RAM will need to be replaced.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table Specs table table-hover"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Brand</strong></td><td>Skytech Gaming</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics Coprocessor</strong></td><td>GeForce RTX 3090 24G GDDR6X</td></tr><tr><td><strong><strong>Operating System</strong></strong></td><td>Windows 10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU Model</strong></td><td>Core i9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hardware Interface</strong></td><td>USB, DisplayPort, HDMI, USB 2.0</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>For gaming enthusiasts that want their PC to have both performance and extravagant looks, Skytech’s Omega Gaming prebuilt PC has plenty to offer. Firstly, of course, it features an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 GPU – though the brand of the aftermarket model may vary, depending on what they have in stock – some buyers mention receiving an MSI Trio X model of the GPU, while others a PNY XLR8 variant. This is to be expected with a pre-built PC, as stock for the GeForce RTX 3090 is still scarce.</p>



<p>In terms of its CPU, this desktop features an Intel Core i9-10900K, so its gaming and single-core performance will be in the upper echelon of what the current generation of hardware can process.</p>



<p>Next, for RAM, we have 32 GB of G.Skill’s TidentZ RGB model, in four ranks of 8 GB. This RAM will have a base frequency of 3,600 MHz, but it is unclear what Column Access Strobe (CAS) latency these units will have. At 3,600 MHz, the most optimal latency would be 16 cycles, which hopefully it includes. 32 GB of RAM is plenty for most gaming builds, but additional RAM storage may be needed for those looking to use the PC for streaming or content creation.</p>



<p>The motherboard included will, most likely, be the ASRock Z490 Phantom Gaming Velocita. This motherboard has a 10+2+1 (13-phase) VRM solution that uses SIC654A/SIC632A 50-amp MOSFETs and 60-amp power chokes – and all MOSFETs are heatsinked. It has four DDR4 DIMM slots, a standard, yet solid, Realtek ALC1220 audio codec, which includes a 120 dB differential amplifier, two armored M.2 slots (1 TB NVMe drive included) and a ton of connectivity (including a Thunderbolt AIC connector). Overall, a solid option for a motherboard – not high end, but it works for this build.</p>



<p>The power supply is one component that may need replacing, as it is 850 Watts (on the lower end for an Intel i9-10900K and a GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, both of which are power demanding), and it appears to have only an 80 PLUS White certification, meaning a power efficiency of just the baseline 80 PLUS value (80%). This is common in pre-built PCs, as the power supply is often overlooked. We would recommend a 1,000 Watt PSU with a Platinum (or at least Gold) 80 PLUS certification to be replace this piece.</p>



<p>Another set of components that are often overlooked comprise the PC’s cooling solution. For this case, we have a 360 mm AIO liquid cooler for the CPU, four Jupiter AJ 120 mm fans, and one 80 mm rear fan. Because the fans are not of the best quality, and the case itself has a tempered glass side panel – so it is not optimized for quiet operation – the PC can get loud, with one user reporting 59 decibels of noise emissions emanating from the case.</p>



<p>All in all, for those looking to purchase a gaming PC that is visually appealing and includes the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, the Skytech Omega Gaming PC desktop is a solid option and is currently priced at $3,549.99.</p>

<p>If you’re planning on building a brand-new gaming PC for high-framerate 1080p gaming, then nothing beats the combination of AMD’s new Ryzen 5 5600X and Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.</p>



<p>This CPU and GPU pairing provides the best cost-for-performance ratio – so their accompanying hardware must do the same. We sought out to find components that meet this exact, demanding, criteria, in order to provide a recommendation for the best PC build that features these new-generation models. The total cost of this build: <strong>$1,322.73 &#8211; $1381.52</strong> – depending on your cooling preference (RGB, white LED, or no illumination).</p>



<p>Without further ado, let’s get right into the components:</p>

<p>AMD’s new Zen 3 Ryzen 5 5600X is already hailed as one of the best, if not <em>the </em>best gaming CPU currently available. One thing is for sure, this processor is definitely the most cost-efficient of all new generation options; from both AMD and Intel.</p>



<p>The Ryzen 5 5600X features a 6 core, 12 thread, setup; with 32 MB of level 3 cache and a Thermal Design Power of just 65 watts: making it the most energy-efficient CPU for its level of performance. All cores, threads, and L3 cache are situated onto a single Core Complex (CCX) in the Core Chiplet Die (CCD) which is built using a TSMC 7nm FinFET processing node. The Ryzen 5 5600X has a base clock frequency of 3.7 GHz, which can be boosted to 4.6 GHz, is PCIe 4.0 compatible, and comes equipped with an AMD Wraith Stealth CPU cooler. In terms of RAM, this CPU supports dual channel DDR4 memory, with a base speed of up to 3,200 MHz.</p>



<p>Benchmarks for the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, carried out by <a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2135-amd-ryzen-5600x/" rel="nofollow">TechSpot</a>’s, show us that not only can this processor reach high-end framerates, but it also has the best cost-per-frame ratio among all its competition (for both single and multi-core performance).</p>



<p>The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X has an MSRP of $300.</p>

<p>Another key component for running the CPU optimally, without overheating, and with enough current to be overclocked to your heart’s content, is the motherboard. To ensure these parameters, we’ve chosen the Gigabyte B550 AORUS Pro AC: a top-tier B550 motherboard that displays the incredible value for its cost.</p>



<p>The AORUS Pro AC makes use of a 14-phase VRM solution, with Vishay VRPower SiC651(A) 50-amp MOSFETs in a [6 + 6] CPU VCC + 2 SoC VCC configuration. These MOSFETs are all heatsinked, and the motherboard includes a heatpipe connecting the heatsinks for better heat dissipation throughout.</p>



<p>Four DDR4 RAM slots that can hold up to 128 GB of DDR4 memory, and the supported RAM can be overclocked to frequencies up to 5,200 MHz.</p>



<p>Next, we have three PCIe x16 lanes, one of which is PCIe 4.0 and two of which are PCIe 3.0. Storage wise, it can hold six SATA III 6 GB/s hard drives (all ports are situated at 90 degrees) as well as two M.2 form factor SSDs (both include a heatsink cover). Do note that using the second M.2 slot (PCIe 3.0) will disable the fourth PCIe 3.0 x16 lanes.<em></em></p>



<p>This variant of the Gigabyte AORUS Pro also includes an Intel Wireless-AC 3168 wireless module for 802.1.1 ac WiFi; as well as a Realtek ALC1220 VB audio codec. Also important to mention is the impressive connectivity of the AORUS Pro AC, which has three USB 3.1, three USB 3.0, and six USB 2.0 ports in the rear I/O panel; as well as eight fan pump cooling headers.</p>



<p>Considering all of the above, the fact that you can currently find the Gigabyte B550 AORUS Pro AC for just $169.99 makes it an easy choice to make.</p>

<p>When it comes to ROM, few can compete with Crucial in regards to the quality they provide at such competitive prices. One of the most popular M.2 form factor SSDs they have released is the Crucial P1.</p>



<p>Because gaming applications will generally see little to no difference in performance between a SATA III and NVMe interface, going for high-end PCIe 4.0 SSDs is simply a waste of money. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIXSSOzyLbs&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">NCIX Tech Tips</a> has proven that SSDs, of any interface protocol, will perform similarly when it comes to loading assets for gaming.</p>



<p>For just under $100, the Crucial P1 offers 1 TB of 3D NAND ROM using Micron’s 64L 3D QLC. The P1 can reach a sequential read speed of 2 GB/s, a sequential write speed of 1.7 GB/s, a QD1 random read speed of 170,000 IOPS, and a QD random write speed of 240,000 IOPS. It also has a durability rating of 200 Terrabytes Written (TBW) – which is backed by Crucial’s 5-year warranty.</p>



<p>The Crucial P1 1 TB SSD can currently be found for only $99.99: An excellent price for an SSD that does its job without the need to overperform.</p>

<p>The low thermal power demands of the aforementioned components, especially the CPU and GPU, allow us to use a 650-watt power supply, which will more than suffice for powering the build.</p>



<p>Still, we need this PSU to have a high energy efficiency rating, since the PC is meant for gaming and can be used for hours on end. This is why we’ve chosen Thermaltake’s Toughpower GF1 650 W 80 PLUS Gold certified PSU.</p>



<p>With an energy efficiency of at least 87%, all-Japanese 105-degree Celsius certified capacitors, and a fully modular design – meaning that all cables can be removed, so you don’t have to cram them in the case if you don’t use them – the Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 has all the specifications found in high-end power supplies at a budget price. Additionally, it features excellent cooling, with the use of a PWM-controlled 140 mm fan with top-of-the-line hydraulic bearings – for better durability and low noise production – as well as a zero-cable design (no internal wires, the daughterboards are directly soldered onto the platform). To further ensure reduced noise output, this PSU’s fan does not spin unless the PSU’s workload is above 30%, so it is virtually inaudible at low loads.</p>



<p>Despite its 650 W power output, hydraulic-bearing fan, high level of efficiency, and high-quality internal components, the Thermaltake Toughpower GF1 costs just $106.97, making it perfect for this build.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the components that the PC will be comprised of, we need a proper case to house them – as well as some proper cooling to keep them operating at safe temperatures. When it comes to cases, one of the best and most reputable companies in Taiwan’s Lian Li; and the particular model that we recommend is the mid-tower: Lian Li LANCOOL 205.</p>



<p>This case has a minimalistic and sleek aesthetic, with a tempered glass side panel and two colors to choose from: black and white. It has a design that lends itself to easy installation, with removable SSD mounting brackets, swappable front and top fan brackets, and a side panel PSU with an HDD bay that can fit two 2.5”-3.5” hard drives. Another convenient feature is the extra space it has behind the motherboard tray that allows you to tuck in and hide cables for better cable management and an overall cleaner look. In fact, to keep the inside of the case dust-free, the LANCOOL 205 includes two magnetic dust filters (on top and in the front), together with a dust filter tray at the bottom, for easier cleaning.  </p>



<p>In terms of fans, this case can hold five: one 120 mm fan in the rear, two 120 mm or 140 mm fans on top, and two 120 mm or 140 mm fans upfront. Two 120 mm fans are included with the purchase, and are preinstalled in the rear and on the top. Note that the right-side panel is also ventilated for overall better airflow.</p>



<p>Finally, the front I/O panel includes two USB 3.0 ports and two 3.5 mm audio jacks. The best aspect of the Lian Li LANCOOL 205, however, is its price, as it can currently be purchased for only $69.99-$74.99 (depending on the color).</p>

<h3 id="h-cooling">Cooling</h3>



<p>Though the included case fans are respectable in their own right, it’s always good to try and max out the airflow cooling within the case to ensure that temperatures are always kept at a minimum. Of course, this also gives us the opportunity to add some extra flare to the appearance of the PC, which can be done with some LED illumination. For the LANCOOL 205 we have three different options that you can choose from, depending on your preference. One is (our recommended) white LED lighting, the other is a more conventional RGB lighting, and the third is no lighting whatsoever, with a focus purely on performance.</p>

<p>Since the Lian Li LANCOOL 205 can be purchased in white, we recommend going five Corsair ML120 PRO White LED case fans. This will give it a uniform and bright aesthetic, with a simple yet stylish design.</p>



<p>These 120 mm Corsair case fans are not just all show, as they have the best bearings money can buy: magnetic levitation bearings. This means they produce less noise (maxing out at around 37 decibels, which is about as loud as a whisper) and have a much longer lifespan. They operate between 400 to 2,400 RPM, are PWM controlled (only spin when necessary), have a static pressure of 4.2 mmH2O, and an airflow of 75 CFM. These fans cost $25.99 each, so for five units, it would cost about $130.</p>

<p>Focused on their second-generation ray tracing capabilities, Nvidia has released another GeForce RTX 30 Series GPU that features their new Ampere architecture: The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.</p>



<p>This lower-mid range graphics card offers all the new features found with the release of Nvidia’s most recently released GPUs – like DLSS 2.0, AI powered Studio and Broadcast, and Nvidia’s Reflex (which lowers overall input lag) – and does so at a much lower price than its higher-end counterparts.</p>



<p>With its 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM, 1.41 GHz base clock speed, and theoretical performance of 133.2 GPixels/s, the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti has proven to be able to reach well over 144 FPS at 1080p for the majority of tested titles (<a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2155-geforce-rtx-3060-ti/">TechSpot</a>). It does struggle with 4K gaming at 60 FPS (if processing games at their maximum graphical settings), as well as 120 FPS at 1440p, but for 1080p gaming this GPU is perfect; even for the most demanding triple-A titles.</p>



<p>Of course, the resulting framerate is also dependent on the CPU that it will be paired with, which is why we’ve listed the four best processors to complement the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti – for both Intel, and AMD fans alike.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table Specs table table-hover"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Brand</strong></td><td>Intel</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU Model</strong></td><td>Core i5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU Speed</strong></td><td>4.1 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor Count</strong></td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cache Size</strong></td><td>12 MB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>First off, we have Intel’s mid-range Core i5-10600K. Though this CPU does not reach the <a href="https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/2135/bench/Average-o.png" rel="nofollow">framerate levels</a> of the other processors on this list, it is far less costly and still capable of excellent 1080p gaming at high refresh rates. It is also readily available and currently in stock.</p>



<p>The i5-10600K makes use of Intel’s 14 nm processing node and comes equipped with 6 cores, 12 threads, and 12 MB of Intel’s Smart Cache. It features an amazingly high base frequency of 4.10 GHz, which can be boosted to above 4.80 GHz. What’s slightly unfortunate about the i5-10600K’s design is its Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 125 W – which is way too high for its performance output. In an attempt to lower this power demand, the processing frequency can be throttled to 3.80 GHz in order to decrease the TDP to 95W – which is admittedly still quite high.</p>



<p>The memory that this processor can support is of DDR4 type, with two memory channels and a max memory bandwidth of 41.6 GB/s. The supported base operating speed of said memory is only 2,666 MHz, but it can be overclocked to speeds above 3 GHz.</p>



<p>What’s more, the i5-10600K includes an Intel UHD Graphics 630 integrated processor that supports 4K at 60 Hz, DirectX, OpenGL, InTru 3D, and Intel Clear Video HD for up to three displays.</p>



<p>The i5-10600K can currently be purchased for $219.99</p>

<p>Going a step above the Intel Core i5 CPU, we have the i7-10700K. This processor reaches framerates similar to AMD’s Ryzen 5 5600X and is readily available for purchase – at a price not so far above AMD’s option.</p>



<p>The i7-10700K makes use of Intel’s 14 nm lithography, with a core and thread count similar to current generation consoles: 8 cores and 16 threads. It has a base operating frequency of 3.80 GHz, which can be overclocked to an impressive 5.10 GHz. It has 16 MB of Intel’s Smart Cache, a bus speed of 8 GT/s, and a TDP of 125 W (which can be configured down to 95 W by sacrificing 300 MHz of base operating frequency). This CPU also includes Intel’s Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 Frequency, which identifies the best-performing cores of the CPU and provides them with thermal headroom for increased performance.</p>



<p>The i7-10700K can support DDR4 RAM with a max bandwidth of 45.8 GB/s and a speed of 2,933 MHz.</p>



<p>Like the i5-10600K, this CPU also has the same Intel UHD 630 Graphics processor, which is always great to have.</p>



<p>For $316 (price fluctuates), the i7-10700K makes an excellent pairing for Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti; for any resolution or refresh rate.</p>

<p>Next, we have AMD’s most recent CPU offerings: The Ryzen 5000 Series processors. These CPUs offer unprecedented performance; not just for gaming but for multicore dependent applications as well.</p>



<p>The Ryzen 5 5600X makes use of 6 cores, 12 threads, and 32 MB of L3 Cache – all situated in a single Core Complex (CCX) – which means minimal inter-core latency. It has a base clock speed of 3.7 GHz, a boost clock speed of 4.6 GHz, a 7 nm TSMC FinFET CMOS, and a TDP of only 65 W. Additionally, this CPU is PCIe 4.0 compatible – which the Intel 10<sup>th</sup> generation processors are not.</p>



<p>The Ryzen 5 5600X can support DDR4 RAM with speeds of up to 3,200 MHz, and its purchase includes an AMD Wraith Stealth air CPU cooler. It, of course, does not come with an integrated graphics processor, unlike Intel’s offerings.</p>



<p>The most troublesome aspect of the Ryzen 5 5600X is its availability, as it can be very difficult to find. It does have an MSRP of $300, which is a great price for its single and multicore performance, but can rarely be found at that price as of now.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we have AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800X, which fully optimizes AMD’s new Zen 3 architecture.</p>



<p>A single CCX that is packed to the brim with 8 cores, 16 threads, and 32 MBs of L3 Cache. It has a base clock speed of 3.8 GHz, a boost clock speed of 4.7 GHz, and a TDP of 105 Watts. It also uses AMD’s TSMC 7 nm FinFET lithography, PCIe 4.0 compatibility, and identical memory system specifications – though, unlike the Ryzen 5 5600X, it does not include a CPU cooler.</p>



<p>Benchmarks show us that the Ryzen 7 5800X reaches almost identical gaming <a href="https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/2135/bench/Average-o.png" rel="nofollow">benchmarks</a> with Intel’s i9-10900K, meaning that this CPU is best suited for providing extremely high framerates at 1080p, and 1440p resolutions. At 4K, most of the load falls upon the GPU, which means the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti will most likely will still struggle to reach the standard 60 FPS.</p>



<p>Once again, the issue with this processor is its limited availability. It can currently be found on Amazon, but well above its $549 MSRP.</p>

<h2 id="h-verdict">Verdict</h2>



<p>All in all, the best CPUs for this GPU appear to be the i5-10600K for 1080p and 144 Hz processing – due to its budget price – and the Ryzen 5 5600X, for both 1080p and 1440p resolutions. The Ryzen 7 5800X and i7-10700K are also great futureproofing options, due to their increased core and thread counts.</p>

<p>After the “release” of AMD’s first couple of Radeon RX 6000 Series GPUs, Nvidia answers back with the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti: A GPU that has no equal at its lower/mid-end price range. This graphics card is capable of displaying respectable framerates at high resolutions – similar to, and higher than, the GeForce RTX 2080 Super – at only a fraction of the cost of the other Nvidia 30 Series GPUs that feature the Ampere architecture.</p>



<p>To display the full graphical processing potential of the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, you will need a monitor that can play to its strengths, and not go beyond its capabilities. To assist in this search, we’ve created a list of the best monitors for the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti; depending on resolution and framerate.</p>

<p>Where the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti excels, is producing high framerates at 1080p. Therefore, if you don’t mind Full HD resolutions, in terms of visual appeal, a 1080p 144 Hz display is definitely the way to go. The best model for its price? The Viewsonic Elite XG2705.</p>



<p>This monitor can be purchased at either a 24-inch (XG2405), or 27-inch (XG2705) screen size, and it features an IPS panel with an 8-bit bit-depth: 6-bits plus Frame Rate Control (FRC). Its W-LED backlight is capable of displaying 1.68 million colors at 24 bits. covering an impressive 104% of the sRGB color spectrum and 72% of the NTSC color space. The XG2705 can reach a peak brightness of 250 nits, a static contrast ratio of 1000 to one (80,000,000: 1 dynamic contrast), and a Grey-to-Grey (G2G) response time of only 1 millisecond. Also, due to its IPS panel, it has a wide horizontal, and vertical, viewing angle of 178 degrees.</p>



<p>In terms of ergonomics, the screen can be mounted (VESA), pivot to the right (90 degrees), swivel in both directions (90 degrees), tilt forwards, and backward (5 and 20 degrees), and have its height adjusted by up to 120 mm.</p>



<p>Two HDMI 1.4 slots, one DisplayPort 1.2, and a 3.5 mm audio jack comprise its connectivity.</p>



<p>The ViewSonic Elite XG2705 can currently be found on sale for only $209.99; while, oddly enough, the 24-inch variant costs nearly double that at $399.99 – perhaps due to low current availability.</p>

<p>If you want to go a step beyond the 1080p resolution, but also don’t want to worry about having to lower your games’ graphical settings, then 1440p at 60 Hz is an excellent resolution-framerate combination.</p>



<p>The Dell Gaming S2716DGR is a 27-inch monitor with a TN panel (8-bit bit-depth) that may lack the wide viewing angle of its IPS counterparts (170H, 160V), but makes up for it with exceptionally low input lag. It has a G2G response time of just 1 ms, an average response time of 3 ms, and a maximum response time of only 5 ms. The W-LED backlight displays 1.68 million colors (24 bits): covering 99% of the sRGB color space and 72% of the NTSC color space. It can reach a 350-nit brightness, and a static contrast ratio of 1000 to one.</p>



<p>The S2716DGR is extremely versatile in terms of ergonomics and has an impressive level of connectivity (5x USB 3.0, 1x HDMI 1.4, 1x DP 1.2). It also makes use of Nvidia’s Ultra Low Motion Blue (ULMB), 3D Vision, and G-Sync technology.</p>



<p>The Dell Gaming S2716DGR can currently be found for $360.77; though its price does vary according to availability.</p>

<p>The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti may not achieve framerates above 120 Hz consistently, according to the <a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/2155-geforce-rtx-3060-ti/" rel="nofollow">benchmarks carried out by TechSpot</a>, but there do exist solutions that can make this refresh rate possible at 1440p. The easiest of which is lowering the graphical quality from the in-game settings: Removing shadows, lowering SSR, or even reducing the depth of field.</p>



<p>If you don’t mind making these minor sacrifices, then a monitor that can display all the glory of both high-resolution and high-frame-rate gaming – and can last even after you potentially upgrade the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti in the future – is the ASUS TUF Gaming VG27AQ.</p>



<p>This monitor has an AHVA IPS panel with a bit-depth of 8 bits and a W-LED backlight that is capable of displaying 1.68 million colors – or 99% of the sRGB color spectrum. It has an impressive 1,200 to 1 static contrast ratio, a peak brightness of 350 nits, and its refresh rate can be overclocked to 165 Hz. Where this monitor shines is its incredibly low input lag: with a Motion Picture Response Time (MPRT) of 1 ms, a G2G of 4 ms, and a display input lag of just 5.3 ms.</p>



<p>The VG27AQ has a full array of ergonomic features, two 2W speakers, two HDMI 2.0 ports, one DP 1.2 slot, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. It also includes a plethora of features: like a 5-way OSD joystick, Extreme Low Motion Blur, and Shadow Boost.</p>

<p>If you are looking to max out the capabilities of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, and want to enjoy your games at the highest possible gaming processing resolution, then a 3840 x 2160 at 60 Hz monitor is for you. <a href="https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/2155/bench/4K-o.png" rel="nofollow">Benchmarks</a> do show that the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti reaches an 18-game average of 64 FPS at 4K, so it must be noted that there may be some titles that you will have to lower the in-game quality settings in order to fully enjoy gaming at this resolution. If that’s a sacrifice you are willing to make, the ASUS VP28UGQ is a monitor well worth investing in.</p>



<p>This display features a TN panel (10-bit bit-depth) that has a MPRT of just 1 millisecond, and an end-to-end input lag having been measured to reach just 27.4 ms (dependent on the PC and peripherals as well). It’s W-LED backlight display can show over a billion colors at 30 bits: covering 100% of the sRGB spectrum. It has a 300-nit brightness and a 1000 to one static contrast ratio.</p>



<p>Because the VP28UGQ is meant to be viewed from the front, it does lack many ergonomic features, but it does have a view light frame and it can be mounted using a VESA interface. It can also be tilted by 5 degrees forwards and 20 degrees backwards. Also included are two HDMI 2.0 ports, one DP 1.2, a 3.5 mm audio out jack, and a several features similar to the ASUS VG27AQ.</p>



<p>Arguably, the best part of the ASUS VP27UGQ is its current $252.63 price tag.</p>
