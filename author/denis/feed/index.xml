<p>The Intel Core i5-11600K is one of Intel&#8217;s most solid desktop processors. It can handle most of the daily home and office computing tasks flawlessly. It also features a thermal design power of 125W.</p>



<p>However, it does not have the required thermal solution, and the maximum allowed temperature is 212 degrees Fahrenheit. For a processor as powerful as this one, you may need a CPU cooler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make its performance sustainable, you may have to invest in the best CPU cooler for i5. This way, you can ensure you get the maximum efficiency from your PC.</p>



<p>In this article, we shall look at some of the best CPU coolers for i5-11600K available in the market. Let&#8217;s dive into it!</p>



<h2 id="h-quick-tips-for-shopping-cooler-for-your-i5-11600k">Quick Tips for Shopping Cooler for Your i5 11600k&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Before we indulge in the choices, let&#8217;s understand how to pick the best CPU cooler for i5. Here are some important factors you must look for when shopping for this product.</p>



<h3 id="h-thermal-design-power">Thermal Design Power</h3>



<p>Thermal Design Power or TDP is a vital factor to consider before purchasing a CPU cooler. TDP refers to the amount of heat a CPU produces when it works at its base clock. The TDP of this particular processor is 125 W.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hence, check the thermal design power of the cooler before purchasing it. In many cases, the air and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_cooling">liquid coolers</a>&nbsp;specify the rating in their listing. However, if they do not, you can look up about them online.</p>



<p>If you buy a cooler with a lower TDP rating, the fan will function loudly, and the CPU may throttle. It can be damaging to the system in the longer run. So, it is wise to invest in a cooler with higher TDP ratings that run soundlessly and lower your CPU&#8217;s temperature significantly.</p>



<h3 id="h-types-of-coolers">Types of Coolers</h3>



<p>Primarily there are two types of coolers that you can choose from for your CPU. They are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/cpu-cooler-liquid-cooling-vs-air-cooling.html">air coolers and water coolers</a>.</p>



<h4 id="h-air-cooler">Air Cooler</h4>



<p>Air coolers can be an amazing choice for you if you have a custom desktop or laptop. Moreover, air coolers are the most popular kind of additional coolers when you need more than a stock cooler.</p>



<p>Generally, air coolers are larger than water coolers. Hence, it can not fit perfectly with multiple PC cases. Further, most air coolers, especially aftermarket ones, run at higher speeds and make louder noises.</p>



<h4 id="h-water-cooler">Water Cooler</h4>



<p>Water coolers or liquid coolers are an upgrade to air coolers. Usually, they perform better than air coolers at maintaining the temperature of the processor. Plus, they are available in a wide range of sizes to fit almost any system size.</p>



<p>However, you can avoid this if you do not use your system frequently and do not overheat all that much. Moreover, water coolers can be more expensive and potentially hazardous if the liquid ever leaks.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-integrated-heat-spreader">Integrated Heat Spreader</h3>



<p>Integrated Heat Spreader or IHS is the name for the top silver cover part on a CPU. It is a flat copper plate that protects the core of the CPU. So, why does IHS matter?</p>



<p>It is important because IHS provides a pathway for heat exchange between the cooler and the CPU. It also protects the processing silicon. Usually, soldered IHS is better than unsoldered since it provides a better path for heat exchange.</p>



<h3 id="h-thermal-interface-material">Thermal Interface Material</h3>



<p>Thermal Interface Material or TIM is a very smooth component that bridges the IHS and the cooler. The smoother it is, the better the conductibility of the unit. However, it is very difficult to manufacture a completely smooth TIM. Hence, they use conductive or non-conductive pastes to smoothen it artificially.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-quiet-operation">Quiet Operation</h3>



<p>Most people prefer a quiet operating system over a noisy one. It is especially true if you are a gamer, graphic designer, or content creator. You would prefer to work in an environment with fewer noisy disturbances.</p>



<p>Therefore, it is a good factor to look for when buying a new cooler for your PC. Moreover, most high-quality coolers ensure to incorporate quiet operation as a feature.</p>



<h3 id="h-style">Style</h3>



<p>CPU coolers usually stand out in the crowd of numerous components. Hence, it is safe to say the style of the coolers is an important factor to consider. So, do not forget to choose a cooler based on its style after its performance.</p>



<p>Moreover, there are many types of coolers available in the market. They come in a multitude of sizes, shapes, colors, and designs. So, pick what you like so the aesthetic will be pleasing every time you see through the case window.</p>



<h3 id="h-rgb">RGB</h3>



<p>Many people prefer a color with an RGB customization option. If you are one of them, you should definitely go for it! You can choose from a wide variety of RGB coolers that offer RGB lighting and fans.</p>



<p>Additionally, it is important to ensure you can turn on and off the RGB whenever you want to. It can have a built-in controller or a compatible motherboard header while you plug it in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it can be helpful when you can turn off the RGB lights without turning off your system.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-i-know-what-cooler-will-fit-in-my-system">How Do I Know What Cooler Will Fit in My System?</h2>



<p>No matter which type or style of cooler you are opting for, you need to ensure it fits your system. So, how can you know if the cooler you like fits your CPU?</p>



<p>Firstly, you must check for the CPU socket and any potential chassis limitations for cooler height or radiator size for i5 11600k. A socket is a part that provides an electrical and mechanical connection between the motherboard and the processor.</p>



<p>You can check the &#8220;Socket Supported&#8221; in the CPU package, its&nbsp;<a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/212275/intel-core-i5-11600k-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz.html">official website</a>, or the product listing. Then, compare the socket information, the TPD of the i5 11600k, with the socket info on the cooler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it matches, you know the cooler is going to fit in your system. Moreover, the socket supported for i5-11600k is FCLGA1200.</p>



<h2 id="h-installing-cpu-cooler-for-i5-11600k">Installing CPU Cooler for i5-11600k</h2>



<p>To ensure you are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0faokWMZbc">installing your CPU cooler</a>&nbsp;correctly, I am providing you a guide. Here is a step-by-step process of installing a CPU cooler.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-1-apply-thermal-paste">Step #1. Apply Thermal Paste</h3>



<p>Before you fix your cooler in your CPU, check for thermal paste. It is a thin layer of a thermal compound that removes the gap between the cooler&#8217;s base and the CPU lid. Most coolers come with thermal paste in place, yet not all of them do.</p>



<p>So, if it is not there, you can apply the thermal paste. Remember to apply only a small amount. All you have to do is apply a small dot of the paste in the center of the CPU lid.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-2-set-up-standoffs">Step #2. Set Up Standoffs</h3>



<p>This step is an optional step depending on the cooler and motherboard combination. You can use a standoff that screws through the motherboard into the case or a bracket that sits behind the motherboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the cooler you purchase comes with these components, attach them after seeing if they are appropriate. Also, if you are using a water cooler, you have to install the radiator in your case.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-3-attach-the-cooler">Step #3. Attach the Cooler</h3>



<p>Firstly, line up the screws with the holes in the motherboard carefully. Then, lower the cooler into the CPU and screw in the connectors. You can use an X pattern to screw it tight.</p>



<p>Start by tightening loosely at first, then increase the tension as you go on. Make sure to screw in evenly across the board since it can create uneven pressure distribution if you do not. Then, attach any fans or connect them to the radiator depending on the type of cooler.</p>



<h3 id="h-step-4-plug-in">Step #4. Plug-In</h3>



<p>Once you attach everything in the CPY, you have to plug in everything. All parts need power despite the type of cooler. The plugging varies from one cooler to another so that you can connect it according to its design.</p>

<p>It offers a high level of performance at lower decibels of 21.4 dB, which is lesser than most other coolers. However, some coolers produce less than 21.4 dB at high speed, yet they can not match this cooler&#8217;s performance.</p>



<p>Moreover, it has an excellent single tower layout which makes it highly compatible with i5-11600K. Further, the TDP rating is better than other coolers, and it is at 200W. Hence, it is an optimal cooler if you want your computer to perform at its peak levels.</p>



<p>This cooler offers easy installation, which is not common in high-end coolers like this one. Plus, it has powerful wave-contoured and airflow-optimized cooling fins.</p>



<p>All these factors make this cooler the best CPU cooler for i5-11600K available in the market!</p>

<h2 id="h-quick-buying-guide">Quick Buying Guide</h2>



<p>I shall now be dictating a few things that you can keep in mind while deciding on the CPU Cooler you need! These factors are essential and generally make or break our decision.</p>



<h3 id="h-tdp-or-thermal-design-power">TDP or Thermal Design Power</h3>



<p>Well, I can&#8217;t say it enough, but TDP matters the most when it comes to CPU Cooler. On a cooler buying spree? Always check for the handleable TDP Value at the back of the product.</p>



<p>Now, you may think, what is this TDP? Thermal design power refers to the maximum heat produced by a processor at its peak performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, if the cooler can handle the heat given off by the processor, you&#8217;re winning! If not, then my friend, your money might have gone to waste, and I wouldn&#8217;t want that for you!</p>



<p>So, make it a rule to check the TDP value of both your CPU and the value your CPU cooler can handle.</p>



<h3 id="h-cooler-type">Cooler Type</h3>



<p>The market has an array of CPU coolers. They might look the same from the top, but let me tell you, they function very differently!</p>



<p>The types are air coolers or Liquid Coolers broadly. Another type is the Open Loop Coolers.</p>



<h3 id="h-air-coolers">Air Coolers</h3>



<p>Air Coolers are the best fit for a low budget and a good investment. The only reason to pick Air coolers is because of the fewer moving parts and easy installation!&nbsp;</p>



<p>They mainly have metal heatsinks and fans in their composition. A variety of shapes, sizes, and TDP based air coolers are there in the market!</p>



<h3 id="h-liquid-coolers">Liquid Coolers</h3>



<p>If you can spend a little extra buck on your CPU Cooler, I will surely recommend Liquid Coolers. Even though they are expensive, you get the best of features.</p>



<p>They work at the maximum capacity too with quiet performance! It is in contrast with the functioning of air coolers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You won’t have to maintain coolant levels for liquid coolers, and the cooling method will be entirely water-based. With water, you might be stuck at whether there would be any leakage or not? So, guys, no worries, these coolers are leak-resistant!</p>



<p>Additionally, the ease of installation is a bright feature. You can also invest in some overclocking!</p>



<h3 id="h-open-loop-coolers">Open Loop Coolers</h3>



<p>Open Loop Coolers are pricey bets. But the coolest part is that you get top-class results and great cooling abilities.</p>



<p>&nbsp;On the negative side, the whole build is very complicated and complex. Understanding the specifications of Open Loop Coolers might take some time!&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-socket-compatibility">Socket Compatibility</h3>



<p>Next up, we have the factor of CPU Socket compatibility. Imagine you bought a cooler, and now it isn&#8217;t able to fit the socket of your CPU. Such a sad story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is why you must always check for a model that can fit your CPU in the best and most effective manner.</p>



<h3 id="h-ram-compatibility">RAM Compatibility</h3>



<p>RAM compatibility? It sounds like a term you all might have heard. RAM compatibility is an essential part of purchasing a CPU Cooler. The standard RAM Modules that are around 33 mm go well with most CPU Coolers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RAM with tall heat spreaders might be the cause of an issue. These RAM modules with greater heights and big cooler models may cause heat sinking. The fan might even overhang RAM Slots.</p>



<p>To prevent such mishaps, do check the compatibility of RAM with your cooler.</p>



<h3 id="h-motherboard">Motherboard</h3>



<p>So we talked about RAM and Socket Compatibility; what&#8217;s next? The motherboard.&nbsp; Choosing a cooler that can fit the motherboard is essential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the question arises how we can find that out? Go online and find some motherboard compatibility charts! You will be surprised to know the number of them available just to help you make a more balanced decision.</p>



<h3 id="h-cooler-height-and-case-compatibility">Cooler Height and Case Compatibility</h3>



<p>Both the cooler height and case compatibility need to be aligned to have a great CPU cooler fit. You will have to figure out the clearance space for the CPU Cooler. Once you know that, go for a cooler with a similar height or clearance.</p>



<h3 id="h-noise">Noise</h3>



<p>Does a quiet performance impress you? Do you want a great cooling performance? I am hoping the answer to both these questions is a big yes.</p>



<p>Now that we have our priorities set, choosing a cooler becomes an easy job! Generally, a high-performance cooler has low-speed fans and thus less noise. On the other hand, a maxed-out cooler shall have high-speed fans and produce noise when overclocking the CPU.</p>



<h3 id="h-overclocking">Overclocking</h3>



<p>This term was mentioned previously as well! Overclocking means making the CPU work way faster than the already set limits. High-profile coolers will have the ability to sustain overclocking. Low profile ones only work with the lower TDP CPUs.</p>



<p>I am also attaching a link to a video highlighting some main features to be thoughtful about while making that perfect CPU purchase! Interested? Click on the link below.</p>

<p>I have always been a fan of reasonably priced stuff! Well, who isn&#8217;t? We all start to sweat when it comes to CPU coolers, knowing that it will be an expensive deal. What if I tell you that’s not the case? And that you can get a CPU Cooler for less than $ 50?</p>



<p>Hahaha! I know you’re surprised. Scythe Mugen 5 Rev B is the one for you. The price is extremely low, and the features are top-notch.</p>



<p>The 120 mm Kaze Flex Fan performs a variety of functions. It keeps care of the high airflow and static pressure. Along with that, the fans perform in a very quiet manner, even at a high capacity. With Mugen 5, you all can say goodbye to the noise!</p>



<p>There is an additional fan clip in the set too. That is given just in case users want another optional fan. These extra fans promise to give high performance and work in a push-pull configuration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like Noctua, Scythe also provides users with a thermal compound paste. It is also highly compatible with both AMD Ryzen and Intel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as CPU Socket compatibility is concerned, Scythe Mugen 5 wins hands down! Yes, we mean it. Scythe Mugen 5 Rev B boasts of a spring-loaded mounting system. This system promotes a more easy and secure installation.</p>



<p>You will also get an asymmetrical design with the product. This design is a great help in the RAM compatibility and the unrestricted access to memory banks.</p>



<h3 id="h-conclusion-1">Conclusion</h3>



<p>Life may be tough, but choosing an affordable CPU Cooler isn&#8217;t. I recommend you to go for the Scythe Mugen Rev 5. It is a great combination of reasonable prices and high-quality features. Sounds like a nice plan to me!</p>

<p>Do you have a habit of overclocking your system? Are you a big-time gamer who spends long hours online? If you participate in either one of these habits, you will know how big of an issue it is. It becomes difficult to find CPU Coolers that match your requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, All hail Arctic Liquid Freezer AIO CPU cooler to rectify all these worries. This CPU Cooler promises to be way cooler than the other options in the market. It has a more efficient cool plate, pump, and radiator. These components make it a true blue AIO Cpu Cooler.</p>



<p>The CPU Cooler has an additional 40MM VRM Fan attached near the pump. This fan provides cooling to the base and the voltage transformer. The lower voltage Redualtor temperature stands at 15 degrees Celsius, which is pretty great.</p>



<p>Cables are incredibly managed in the Arctic CPU Cooler. The PWM Cable of the fans is put together in sleeved tubing! Overall there is essentially a single cable that users can see on the top of the pump to the motherboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This cooler is a huge relief for all those sick and tired of the cable mess in CPU Coolers.</p>



<p>Another fantastic feature for this CPU cooler would have to have 80% less power consumption! Arctic brings across this new feature which genuinely makes their CPU cooler stand out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now whenever the pumps are idle, they clock down and thus consume way less power. The noise is also minimum whenever cooling isn’t required.</p>



<p>A solid extended warranty backs the whole idea of the Arctic Liquid Freezer AIO CPU cooler. The company offers a six-year warranty from the day of purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users won&#8217;t have to worry about refilling since the water loop is religiously sealed. It also has high-quality fiber-reinforced EPDM tubing!</p>



<h3 id="h-conclusion-3">Conclusion</h3>



<p>If you are a gamer and have a habit of overclocking, this CPU Cooler might just be the solution for you. Arctic Liquid Freezer AIO CPU cooler is made to help users in heat dissipation and provide the best experience ever!&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am into gaming, and the cool plate of this CPU Cooler is a winner!</p>

<h2 id="h-wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>



<p>This is it from my end, guys! My top 4 best CPU Coolers for i7-11700k. I picked these options after careful research. But if I have to choose one of the following, I would go for Noctua NH D-15.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There isn&#8217;t one feature that Noctua doesn&#8217;t have! It&#8217;s the jack of all trades. Durable? Yes. Quiet? Yes. Top technology? Yes. Good TDP and RAM, motherboard, and Socket Compatibility are some other bright features of the same!</p>



<p>Now, we hope you know which CPU cooler to buy and how to research. Happy Shopping!</p>

This CPU has eight cores and 16 threads. On top of that, you get a great build and performance.</p>



<p>Additionally, you get all these cool features at a reasonable price as well. So, what&#8217;s the issue here? These power-packed CPUs heat up quickly, and you need to cool the temperature to avoid any damage. What do we do now?&nbsp; Enter CPU Coolers! (They are all you need)</p>



<p>If you’re looking for the best CPU Coolers for Ryzen 7 3700x, we have got you covered. Let’s jump in!</p>



<h2 id="h-some-tips-to-buy-the-perfect-cpu-cooler">Some Tips to Buy the Perfect CPU Cooler</h2>



<p>With the market gushing with options, selecting the correct CPU Cooler can be a tricky job. There are various things to consider, and specifically the features with which these CPU coolers come.</p>



<p>To make things a little short, I have a video here detailing some of the essential points to keep in mind before you spend your hard-earned money. Click on the link below to get enlightened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Got a nice idea about choosing the right CPU cooler? Yay, I hope so!</p>



<p>Now, for the people who would rather read to get a descriptive idea of these parameters, read on!&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-cpu-cooler-type">CPU Cooler Type</h3>



<p>The CPU coolers available in the market are broadly divided into air, closed-loop, or all-in-one coolers and, lastly, custom/ open-loop cooling setups.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-air-coolers">Air Coolers&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Air Coolers consist of metal heatsinks and fans. You can buy them in various shapes, sizes and, not to forget, based on thermal dissipation capacities or TDP.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-open-loop-coolers">Open Loop Coolers</h4>



<p>Open Loop Coolers are the most expensive options sold in the market; they are extremely complex as well. You might take some time to understand their nitty-gritty.</p>



<p>On the brighter side, Open Loop Coolers tend to provide top-notch results and cooling performance.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 id="h-aio-or-closed-loop-coolers">AIO or Closed Loop Coolers</h4>



<p>AIO coolers are also referred to as Liquid Coolers. These CPU Coolers are known for their low noise production while working at maximum efficiency. (specifically comparing to air coolers).</p>



<p>For AIO coolers, you won&#8217;t have to cut and fit custom tubes. Neither will you have to maintain coolant levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are even leak-resistant and extremely user-friendly when it comes to the installation part. The only negative is the requirement of the larger case since they need space for a radiator.</p>



<h3 id="h-cpu-socket">CPU Socket</h3>



<p>Buying the CPU Cooler and not being able to fit it in your sockets would be such a&nbsp; waste of money! To save yourself from this misery, almost always choose the cooler model which fits your CPU socket comfortably.</p>



<p>You can go over socket compatibility charts available online to get a clearer idea!</p>



<h3 id="h-motherboard">Motherboard</h3>



<p>Just like your CPU Socket, the motherboard also plays a big role in CPU Cooler selection. You must look for a Cooler that fits your motherboard. You can check for the details using Motherboard compatibility lists on the internet.</p>



<h3 id="h-case-compatibility-and-cooler-height">Case Compatibility and Cooler Height</h3>



<p>Case Compatibility, along with the cooler heights together, accounts for a perfect CPU Cooler fit. The amount of clearance for coolers will depend on the different PC cases. Make a note of the clearance required by your pick of coolers, or calculate the clearance from the case.</p>



<p>Once you have the desired value of clearance, go for the CPU cooler that fits these specifications.</p>



<h3 id="h-ram-compatibility">Ram Compatibility</h3>



<p>Standard RAM modules (up to 33 mm) are extremely compatible with almost all cooler models. The issue arises when the user goes for RAM with taller heat spreaders.</p>



<p>Some big cooler models will heat sink themselves, or the fan might overhang the RAM slots on a motherboard when used with RAM Modules of greater heights.</p>



<p>All in all, you should check the popular models and their tendency to overhang the memory slots.</p>



<h3 id="h-cpu-tdp-thermal-design-power-and-overclocking">CPU TDP (Thermal Design Power) and Overclocking</h3>



<p>The CPU size and design make a lot of difference when choosing a CPU cooler. Generally, big coolers have better cooling performance. These CPU coolers would suit higher TDP CPUs and overclock.</p>



<p>What does overclocking mean, though? Overclocking is the tendency to make your CPU work faster than its stipulated limits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, lower TDP CPUs will work fine with low profile cooler models</p>



<h3 id="h-noise">Noise</h3>



<p>How does noise become a factor here? Well, for starts, as a user, you will, of course, prefer to use a system that works quietly as possible. Cooling performance and noise-making are far more related than you thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A cooler with extra performance headroom for the CPU will have fans with low speeds and less sound.&nbsp; On the contrary, your CPU&#8217;s fully maxed-out cooler shall have fans with high speeds once the CPU is under load.</p>



<p>Keeping all these parameters in mind, you should choose a CPU cooler that matches your CPU&#8217;s TDP class, overclocking tendencies and acceptable noise production.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-pcie-compatibility">PCIe Compatibility</h3>



<p>Just like I mentioned the CPU slot and motherboard compatibility, PCIe compatibility is a crucial point too. Big coolers may tend to overhang the top PCIe slot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do we figure this out, then? I have observed that the whole compatibility largely depends on the cooler size, top PCIe slot placement, and CPU socket location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One should look for compact CPU Coolers that would be compatible in all cases and don’t overhang the top PCIe slot.</p>



<p>So, these are the top factors to be analyzed while buying the best CPU cooler for Ryzen 7 3700X or any other processor for that matter! Next up, I have my personal top 5 CPU coolers to give you the best cooling performance all the time!</p>

<p>Noctua NH D- 15 is my best overall pick! And yes, there are multiple reasons behind that.</p>



<p>Firstly, if you are a big fan of quiet cooling fans, this is the one for you. Noctua provides two NF-A15 140mm fans that come with PWM support. Through this feature, this fan has an automatic speed control which helps in high efficiency. They also provide ultra-quiet operations.</p>



<p>The Design of Noctua NH D-15 is top class. The state-of-the-art dual tower design with six heat pipes and two fans gives you the unparallel cooling performance you need.</p>



<p>The High-end NT-H1 thermal paste and the SecuForm2 mounting system helps in easy installation on a range of Intel and AMD processor CPUs.</p>



<p>The brand names count for me! And Noctua quality is world-renowned. They also come with a fab six-year warranty just in case you face any issues. Noctua NH D-15 is also a big name when we talk about awards.</p>



<p>It has more than 250 awards and recommendations from the top hardware websites and magazines.</p>



<h3 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h3>



<p>As simple as it sounds, Noctua NH D-15 is actually the CPU cooler you need for Ryzen 7 3700x. The high-quality design and top-notch cooling performance make it a dependable and reasonable choice for a great CPU Cooler.</p>

<p>The CORSAIR iCue Software is pretty effective; users can maintain the coolant temperatures and control the RGB lighting. You can also adjust the pump and fan speeds from just one point source of the software.</p>



<p>As mentioned previously, the RGB LED lights bring light to the pump head and produce stunning lighting effects. These effects fit beautifully well with the 2000 RPM fan speed!</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a moderately quiet cooling experience, Corsair performs incredibly well! The cold plate is thermally optimized, and the low noise from the pump helps give you the low noise high performance you need, fellas.</p>

<p>In my eyes, Noctua NH-D15 is a clear winner in the race of the Best CPU Coolers for Ryzen 7 3700x. I don’t say that just because it sounds good! Noctua promises to give users the benefit of great features, reasonable price, and trust of a brand that has been appreciated for many years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of Air Coolers, Noctua NH-D15 is the choice to make! You will get great RAM Compatibility, no noise as such, and even be able to overclock your CPU. I feel you won&#8217;t be left unimpressed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re on the lookout for liquid coolers specifically, then you might shift to Corsair Kraken. I hope this article helped and made things a little simpler for you. Happy Shopping!</p>

<p>The Ryzen 5 3600 is an amazing 65W chip that is quite a pack of power in a small thermal envelope. Moreover, it provides affordable gaming power to anyone looking for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, a common issue with Ryzen 5 3600 is it overheats fast. So, the stock cooler Wraith Stealth is not enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we shall walk through some of the best CPU coolers for Ryzen 5 3600 available in the market. These aftermarket CPU coolers can help you make the best out of the processor&#8217;s performance.</p>



<p>Also, I can help you pick the best CPU cooler for Ryzen 5 3600 for your requirements. So, let&#8217;s get started!</p>



<h2 id="h-a-quick-buyer-s-guide">A Quick Buyer&#8217;s Guide</h2>



<p>Here are some important factors to consider while picking a cooler for Ryzen 5 3600. These factors will ensure you get the best value for your hard-earned money!</p>



<h3 id="h-types-of-coolers">Types of Coolers</h3>



<p>There are primarily two types of coolers that you can pick from that offer excellent cooling. Here are the primary two categories: Liquid coolers and air coolers.</p>



<h4 id="h-liquid-coolers">Liquid Coolers</h4>



<p>Liquid coolers or water coolers use distilled water or other liquids to perform cooling. They are generally more effective at maintaining cooler temperatures during peak performance than air coolers. However, they are more difficult to maintain than air coolers.</p>



<p>You can go with liquid coolers if you are a gamer or someone who uses the processors at their peak for a long time. Otherwise, it may simply not be worth the money you pay for since liquid coolers are usually more expensive.</p>



<h4 id="h-air-coolers">Air Coolers</h4>



<p>Air coolers are an excellent alternative for stock coolers. Moreover, air coolers are generally popular than liquid coolers since they are effective and inexpensive.</p>



<p>Further, air coolers are quite larger than water coolers, yet they are available in a wide range of sizes. They also make more noise at higher speeds than liquid or water coolers.</p>



<h3 id="h-tdp-thermal-design-power">TDP (Thermal Design Power)</h3>



<p>TDP is one of the most important factors to consider while investing in a CPU cooler. The TDP for Ryzen 5 3600 is 65W. It refers to the heat a CPU produces when it works at its base clock.</p>



<p>When you are looking for a cooler, ensure the cooler has more TDP than the processor. You can find the TDP rating on the cooler&#8217;s product listing. If you do not find it on the product listing or packaging, you can check their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/cpu/amd-ryzen-processors/amd-ryzen-5-desktop-processors/amd-ryzen-5-3600">official website</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-speed">Speed</h3>



<p>Speed is an important factor since it plays a vital role in cooling your CPU. The processor is safe when the cooler is propelling air through at an accelerated speed.</p>



<p>Hence, I recommend you choose coolers with a decent spinning speed if it is an air cooler. On the other hand, ensure the liquid component is strong if you plan to purchase a liquid cooler. It should act fast and stay durable for the most efficient temperature reduction.</p>



<h3 id="h-noise-levels">Noise Levels</h3>



<p>The level of noise a cooler produces during its operation is an important factor to acknowledge. If the noise levels of the coolers are too high, it can cause many inconveniences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firstly, it can disturb you with your work. Secondly, the sound waves can interfere with other components in the CPU. Although most high-quality coolers ensure to perform in lowered noises, you may have to discard a good performer for its noise levels.</p>



<h3 id="h-rgb">RGB</h3>



<p>RGB is an excellent feature, yet it is only an option. If you are interested in flashy lights that make your PC look edgier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, make sure to prioritize necessary factors such as performance, durability, and noise levels over&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB</a>. On the other hand, if you do not like the flashy lights or think it is unnecessary, you do not have to waste your time on this feature.</p>



<h3 id="h-ease-of-installation">Ease of Installation</h3>



<p>Usually, AIO (All in One) coolers are more complex to install than a standard cooler. However, the ease of installation depends on the model of the cooler and your processor. Hence, it is important to pick a cooler that is easy to install on your PC.</p>



<p>Water or liquid coolers are more difficult to install than air coolers. It is so because it involves an extra step of installing the radiator and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_fan">fans</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-size">Size</h3>



<p>Air coolers are generally bulkier than water coolers. However, the entire structure stays on one area instead of liquid coolers that you have to distribute across the system. You will need space for the radiator, and it has to be in the proper orientation.</p>



<p>Hence, if you want something effective, you can go with air coolers in a small area. Moreover, they are available in a wide range of sizes. If you want a low-profile air cooler and have enough space for alignment, you go with liquid coolers.</p>

<p>I consider this cooler the best budget CPU cooler for Ryzen 5 3600 for a variety of reasons. Firstly, it has a high airflow capacity at 51.17 cubic feet per minute. It also has an impressive speed ranging between 300 RPM to 1200 RPM.</p>



<p>It has an additional fan clip if you want to add additional fans. It also has a push and pulls configuration for maximum performance. This configuration also ensures the air inside the CPU is cool and fresh all the time.</p>



<p>With these coolers, RAM modules with tall heatsinks are not a problem. It has an asymmetric design which allows excellent access to the memory banks. It is one of the main reasons why this cooler is my top pick for Ryzen 5 3600.</p>



<p>It has 6 x 6 mm heat pipes and a copper plate base. This feature will ensure better heat dissipation and cooling. Moreover, these coolers are very easy to install with their spring-loaded mounting system.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-conclusion-2">Conclusion</h3>



<p>You can pick this if you are looking for a very easy cooler highly-priced to install and work efficiently. The high airflow capacity (51.17 cubic feet per minute) ensures better cooling. Further, I appreciate its push-pull configuration, which helps during long hours of work.</p>

<h2 id="h-final-takeaway">Final Takeaway</h2>



<p>The clear winner is the Corsair H115i RGB Platinum AIO Liquid CPU Cooler! Although this cooler is quite expensive, all the features it provides are extremely beneficial.</p>



<p>It is from a reputed manufacturer that lasts quite longer than most other coolers in the price range. It has an impressive airflow which is at 97 CFM.</p>



<p>Moreover, if you are a fan of RGB lights, you can pick this one since it offers RGB LED lights. You can also use the easy-to-use CORSAIR iCUE software to control and customize the lighting.</p>



<p>It is also very easier to install than many coolers on this list. For instance, Noctua coolers have a SecuFirm2 mounting system, which is good, yet it is not comparable to this cooler&#8217;s installation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has a superior thermally optimized cold plate, which is not common in most coolers. So, this may be the best CPU cooler for Ryzen 5 3600 available in the market!</p>

<h2 id="h-the-best-4k-gaming-monitor-in-2021">The Best 4K Gaming Monitor In 2021</h2>



<p>If you’ve wanted to improve your gaming experience, there has never been a better time to buy a 4K gaming monitor. With recent technological developments, your options are limitless, and there is a 4K monitor for everyone.</p>



<p>A 4K gaming monitor will offer the best user experience, high resolution, large screen size, and fluid usability. Your games will undoubtedly be sharp and realistic.</p>



<p>But how do you choose the best 4K gaming monitor? What are the important things you should keep in mind, and what are the best options available in the market?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ve come to the right place! Get ready to learn everything you need to know before choosing the best 4K monitor.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-benefits-of-a-4k-gaming-monitor">What Are The Benefits Of A 4K Gaming Monitor?</h2>



<p>If you are a gamer who enjoys flawless visuals, a 4K gaming monitor is your answer. There are several benefits to choosing a 4K monitor over a traditional full HD screen.</p>



<h3 id="h-graphical-benefits">Graphical Benefits</h3>



<p>4K gaming monitors consist of tightly packed pixels right next to one another. Moreover, 4K resolution monitors comprise 4 times more pixels than a normal full HD screen. Due to the higher number of pixels, your gaming experience will be much sharper than before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smaller details like clothing and facial expressions will be visible, and even differences in texture are noticeable.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-wide-view">Wide View</h3>



<p>The best 4K gaming monitors provide a large screen surface area. Compared to a traditional full HD screen, you can see more in-game objects in the corners and the sides in a 4K gaming monitor.</p>



<p>A wider field of view also makes your gaming experience realistic and intense since&nbsp;the screen is in your direct line of vision.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-suitable-for-consoles">Suitable for Consoles</h3>



<p>4K gaming monitors are suitable for all gamers, whether you prefer the PC or console systems such as the PlayStation or Xbox.</p>



<p>A few consoles, such as the PlayStation 4 Pro, have been developed specifically so that they can display your games in 4K. The Xbox One S also upscales a full HD image to a 4K resolution.</p>



<h2 id="h-prerequisites-to-using-a-4k-gaming-monitor">Prerequisites To Using A 4K Gaming Monitor</h2>



<p>While buying a 4K gaming monitor is bound to elevate your gaming experience, there are certain prerequisites that you will have to keep in mind:</p>



<h3 id="h-video-card-of-your-pc-or-laptop">Video Card of Your PC or Laptop</h3>



<p>Your laptop or PC must support a 4K image signal if you want to make the most of your 4K gaming monitor. Ensure that you double-check the video card that your computer has before you buy the gaming monitor.</p>



<p>Gaming on a 4K monitor will require the right cable and a strong and reliable video card. Here are a few video cards (graphics) that you may consider:</p>



<ul><li>Intel Iris Plus Graphics</li><li>NVIDIA Quadro Series</li><li>Intel UHG Graphics (from the eighth-generation Intel processors)</li><li>AMD Radeon RX and Pro series</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-connectors-and-cables">Connectors and Cables</h3>



<p>For the complete 4K monitor gaming experience, you will need an HDMI, DisplayPort, USB-C, or Thunderbolt 3 connector.</p>



<p>VGA and DVI connectors are older variants and will not support 4K gaming monitors. HDMI 1.4 may also be sufficient but transfers images at 30Hz, making fast-moving images appear ragged and slow.</p>



<p>Ensure that you choose the right cable for your connector. For the best gaming experience, the cable and connector should match perfectly. For example, a Thunderbolt 3 connector with a Thunderbolt 3 cable. Signals transfer the fastest when the cable and connector match.</p>



<h2 id="h-things-to-look-for-in-the-best-4k-gaming-monitor">Things To Look For In The Best 4K Gaming Monitor</h2>



<p>Buying a 4K gaming monitor may seem like an easy feat, but there are multiple factors to consider. Since this is a huge investment, you cannot make this decision lightly.</p>



<p>If you are unaware of what to look for, the guide is here to help you. Below are some essential factors that should be present in the best 4K monitor.</p>



<h3 id="h-monitor-size">Monitor Size</h3>



<p>You are buying a gaming monitor because you want to get a complete gaming experience. That is why the size of a gaming monitor becomes a very crucial factor. If you choose small sizes, you would not be able to enjoy the gaming experience.</p>



<p>Ideally, the gaming monitor size should not be less than 24 inches. The bigger you go, the better your experience. However, it would help if you also remembered that as the size increases, so will the price.</p>



<h3 id="h-refresh-rate">Refresh Rate</h3>



<p>Refresh rate decides the quality of your visual output and the number of times that the monitor will refresh a visual in one second. Most gaming monitors come in 120Hz or 144Hz since the frame rate is high without any breakage or stuttering.</p>



<p>When you choose monitors with these refresh rates, you need to ensure that the&nbsp;GPU can support the high frame rate. (<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/what-is-a-gpu.html">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/what-is-a-gpu.html</a>)</p>



<p>Some monitors come with higher refresh rates, like 165Hz or even 240Hz. As the refresh rate increases, you need to be cautious that you go for a higher GPU.</p>



<h3 id="h-panel-type">Panel Type</h3>



<p>Monitors come in two-panel types: IPS (in-plane switching) and TN (twisted nematic).&nbsp;</p>



<p>IPS panels are well-known for their visual quality. The picture will be more accurate in color presentation and sharpness. However, the response time is more which is not good for high-end multiplayer games.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the TN panel has a response time of 1ms, which is perfect for competitive gaming. Monitors having TN panels are also a more affordable choice. However, the color saturation is not great, and this could be a problem for AAA single-player games.</p>



<h3 id="h-response-time">Response Time</h3>



<p>Response time is then taken by a single pixel to change from black to white or other shades of grey. This is measures in milliseconds or ms.</p>



<p>When you buy gaming monitors, it is better to choose a&nbsp;higher response time since it will eradicate motion blur and ghosting (<a href="https://www.onecomputerguy.com/1ms-vs-5ms">https://www.onecomputerguy.com/1ms-vs-5ms</a>). Response time between 1ms and 4ms would be good enough for single-player games.</p>



<p>If you are more into playing multiplayer games, it is advisable to choose a lower response time. It would probably be better if you opt for 1ms since this would ensure no pixel response delays.</p>



<h3 id="h-color-accuracy">Color Accuracy</h3>



<p>A 4K gaming monitor’s color accuracy looks into the system’s ability to provide the necessary hue level without making any rough calculations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 4K gaming monitor needs to have color accuracy on the higher end of the spectrum. Most monitors follow a standard RGB pattern to enable color adjustments. But these days, sRGB is quickly becoming the best way to ensure full coverage with perfect color delivery.</p>



<p>The best 4K gaming monitors provide a wide color gamut based on sRGB patterns of color delivery. If the color deviates, the system will present you with an error message represented as a&nbsp;Delta E figure (<a href="https://www.viewsonic.com/library/creative-work/what-is-delta-e-and-why-is-it-important-for-color-accuracy/">https://www.viewsonic.com/library/creative-work/what-is-delta-e-and-why-is-it-important-for-color-accuracy/</a>). Most experts generally consider a Delta E figure of 1.0 to be the best.</p>



<h3 id="h-connectors">Connectors</h3>



<p>A gaming monitor will have ports for input and output. You should try to ensure that the monitor has these connectors &#8211; DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 1.4/2.0, or 3.5mm audio out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some brands offer you other types of connectors in their monitors. However, these are the ports or connectors that are the most important. If you need to plug USB devices directly into the monitor, check for USB ports to help you do so.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-4k-gaming-monitors">Best 4K Gaming Monitors</h2>



<p>Now that you know what to look for while choosing a 4K gaming monitor, we can jump right into some of the best options available in the market right now!</p>



<p>The following overviews will provide you with some details about the unique features of each of these gaming monitors and their general specifications.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-overall-4k-gaming-monitor-lg-27gn950-b">Best Overall 4K Gaming Monitor: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-27GN950-B-Ultragear-Response-Compatibility/dp/B08BCRYS6B?tag=technoburst-01-20" rel="sponsored nofollow">LG 27GN950-B</a>&nbsp;</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Best-Overall-4K-Gaming-Monitor-LG-27GN950-B-1-1024x971.jpg" alt="Best Overall 4k Gaming Monitor Lg 27gn950 B" class="wp-image-3047" width="512" height="486" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Best-Overall-4K-Gaming-Monitor-LG-27GN950-B-1-1024x971.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Best-Overall-4K-Gaming-Monitor-LG-27GN950-B-1-300x285.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Best-Overall-4K-Gaming-Monitor-LG-27GN950-B-1-768x729.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Best-Overall-4K-Gaming-Monitor-LG-27GN950-B-1-580x550.jpg 580w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Best-Overall-4K-Gaming-Monitor-LG-27GN950-B-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure></div>



<figure class="wp-block-table Specs table table-hover"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Screen Size and Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>27 inches, 16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Panel Type</strong></td><td>Nano IPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Refresh Rate</strong></td><td>144 Hz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Response Time (GTG)</strong></td><td>1ms</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Adaptive-Sync</strong></td><td>G-Sync Compatible, FreeSync</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Whether your priority is image quality, speed, high contrast, or accurate color, the LG 27GN950-B has it all. This would be our top recommendation since the 27GN950-B has the best input lag scores available on a 144Hz monitor.</p>



<p>A refresh rate of 144Hz is extremely impressive, and with the right graphics card, you will be able to make the most of this gaming monitor. However, it does have some heavy bandwidth requirements, so make sure you check your graphics card before choosing the 27GN950-B.</p>



<p>It also has an unmatched image quality. With additional features such as an edge array backlight with a local dimming feature, the 27GN950-B offers an impressive contrast ratio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding to this list of benefits, the LG 27GN950-B is fast, responsive, and has a wide color gamut. The Nano IPS aid this color gamut and provides 95% coverage of the DCI-P3 color space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only disadvantage that you might face is that the colors may seem oversaturated, depending on your preferences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The LG 27GN950-B is bound to make your gaming experience worthwhile and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Although the LG OLED48CXPUB is technically a TV, the input lag is low enough to be suitable for PC gaming. The OLED panel makes it ideal for gaming in a dark room as you can turn off individual pixels to produce the perfect effects.</p>



<p>The wide viewing angles allow the images to retain their accuracy at the sides no matter how close to the screen you choose to sit. Response time is also near-instantaneous. You will observe unhindered movement in fast-paced scenes.</p>



<p>The Black Frame Insertion feature improves overall quality, and the HDMI 2.1 inputs will allow you to play 4K with 120Hz for a seamless experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only concern with the LG OLED48CXPUB is the risk of&nbsp;permanent burn-in (<a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/picture-quality/image-retention-burn-in">https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/picture-quality/image-retention-burn-in</a>). This normally occurs when static elements such as the game interface remain on the screen for a longer duration. However, you can undertake steps to mitigate the risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ provides immersive lighting due to its Aura Sync technology. It also supports synchronization with Aura-enabled components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For perfect synchronization, connect your ROG Swift PG27UQ to other peripherals after installing the Aura Sync software on your desktop or laptop. This will provide a stylish backdrop to your game and also syncs the lighting with the music or gaming effects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ provides strong competition for the LG 27GN950-B, with its lightning-fast response rate and wide color gamut. It is the perfect 4K monitor for HDR and will provide a fantastic gaming experience for you.</p>



<p>The only area where it falls short next to the 27GN950-B is that it does not have any features for motion blur reduction. However, if this is an element that you believe will not hinder your gaming, the Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ is a strong contender that you can consider.</p>

<p>The Asus ROG Strix XG27UQ is the fastest 4K monitor out of all the options we have provided you in this review and is also much cheaper than what you would expect. Prices may range anywhere from $800 to $1000.</p>



<p>Even though this model does not have a premium FALD backlight for a stunning HDR display, the HDR performance is still quite satisfactory and fairly impressive. This is because of the screen’s dynamic dimming feature and the efficient edge-array backlight.</p>



<p>In terms of response time, the Asus ROG XG27UQ outperforms most other 4K gaming monitors, including strong competitors such as the Acer Predator X27.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite outperforming Acer’s model, the Asus ROG Strix XG27UQ is cheaper. While the Acer model stands at around $2000, the ROG Strix XG27UQ hovers around $1000.</p>



<p>Along with FreeSync, initial tests suggest that the XG27UQ can also run G-Sync successfully, making it versatile. The monitor also has an extremely low input lag due to the Display Stream Compression (DSC) that supports the fastest possible frame rates.</p>

<h3 id="h-conclusion-4">Conclusion&nbsp;</h3>

<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>The models that we have suggested for you here will guarantee a smooth, immersive, and enjoyable gaming experience. Even though all of them are viable contenders, we would definitely recommend the LG 27GN950-B over the others.</p>



<p>The refresh rate is unbeatable, standing at 144Hz. Combined with a response time of 1ms, the LG 27GN950-B has it all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the Asus ROG Strix XC27UQ provides a similar response time and refresh rate, it has been formally tested only for FreeSync compatibility. It has not yet been listed under G-Sync.</p>



<p>With a monitor size of 27 inches, the LG 27GN950-B offers a wide view, along with perfectly timed visuals. The color accuracy is unmatched, and the contrast ratio is also high.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it may be a little expensive, all the features and benefits it offers are worth the money you would be paying for this 4K gaming monitor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This review and buyer’s guide strives to help you out in your purchasing endeavors, and we hope that it did! Do you have any questions? Or do you think there is something important that we may have missed? Let us know in the comments below! We would love to hear from you!</p>

<p>Curved gaming monitors are the new deal since they have much more to offer than flat monitors. They are not only attractive to look at, but they also provide you with many physical benefits.</p>



<p>Curved monitors offer you a good field of view, so you do not exert your eyes. Just like flat monitors, they come in different sizes. However, unlike flat monitors larger size does not mean more strain on your eyes or increased discomfort.</p>



<p>If you are looking for new gaming monitors, then these 144Hz gaming monitors are the best. They have a standard refresh rate along with enhancing your gaming experience in many different ways.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-choose-the-best-144hz-curved-gaming-monitor">How To Choose The Best 144Hz Curved Gaming Monitor</h2>



<p>Gamers will need to find the right monitor that will enhance their gaming experience. When making this choice, there are several factors that you need to look into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below are some of those factors or features you should consider while buying the best 144Hz curved gaming monitor.</p>



<h3 id="h-pixel-density">Pixel Density</h3>



<p>When it comes to gaming monitors, you should always go for larger screen sizes. The larger your screen size, the better you experience. However, when you increase the size of the screen, you need to keep a note of the pixel density.</p>



<p>Pixel density is the ratio of pixels per inch of the monitor’s size and resolution.</p>



<p>If the pixel density is low, then the image will become pixelated. This means you will be unable to view a clear image, and this will hinder your gaming. Higher pixel density means clearer details and more screen space.</p>



<h3 id="h-screen-size">Screen Size</h3>



<p>Like I discussed, large screen sizes are not always for the best. It is also because large screen sizes will increase your budget. For most gamers, a 27 inches screen would be best for all types of gaming experiences.</p>



<p>They are large but not too much to create discomfort while playing. If the screen is too large, then you need to move your head from one corner to another too much.</p>



<p>When you choose a 27 inches monitor, the ideal resolution will be 2560 x 1440. In this, the pixel density will be approximately 109 pixels per inch. This ensures that you get the right details and screen space without the requirement of any scaling.</p>



<h3 id="h-widescreen-ultrawide-screen">Widescreen / Ultrawide Screen</h3>



<p>The aspect ratio for both these screens is different. In Ultrawide screen, (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2020/10/28/best-ultrawide-monitors-2020-samsung-aw3420dw/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2020/10/28/best-ultrawide-monitors-2020-samsung-aw3420dw/)</a> you get an aspect ratio of 21:9, while in widescreen, you get an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>



<p>The horizontal space for the Ultrawide screen is 33% more than the widescreen. This makes the gaming experience much more engaging. This is extremely important in certain games where you need the field of view to be wide.</p>



<p>Even though most new games support the Ultrawide ratio, not all would be compatible. Games that are not compatible with the 21:9 ratio will give you black borders on both sides. If you do not wish to keep the black borders, you will have to see a stretched-out image.</p>



<h3 id="h-response-time">Response Time</h3>



<p>The response time of your curved gaming monitor is essential. It is the time taken by the monitor to respond to your inputs. When you choose your gaming monitor, ensure that the response time is on the lower scale.</p>



<p>The ideal response time would fall between 1ms and 5 ms. For highly competitive games, it is always advisable to choose a lower response time, preferably 1ms. However, if you are using very large displays, then 5ms would also be quite good.</p>



<h3 id="h-panel-types">Panel Types</h3>



<p>There are three-panel types that are VA (Vertical Alignment), TN (Twisted Nematic), and IPS (In-Panel Switching).</p>



<p>In TN panels, the color reproduction is not as good as IPS panels, but the refresh rates are high. You will not be satisfied with the viewing angles of TN panels, but this may not be a problem for many.</p>



<p>IPS panels have good image quality and color reproduction. However, the refresh rates of these panels are quite low. VA panels are good for most gaming monitors and feature the good factors of the other two panels.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-are-the-advantages-of-a-curved-gaming-monitor">Why Are The Advantages Of A Curved Gaming Monitor?</h2>



<p>Are you unable to decide if you should go for a 144Hz curved gaming monitor or flat monitor? To clear your confusion, I have highlighted some major advantages of curved monitors.</p>



<h3 id="h-immersive">Immersive</h3>



<p>If the image displayed on the monitor does not attract you, you will not get a complete gaming experience. In curved monitors, a technology called ocular perception is used, making you see images like in real life.</p>



<p>Curved monitors take into consideration all three dimensions, which are length, breadth, and height. This gives you an immersive experience which you will not find on flat monitors.</p>



<h3 id="h-eradicates-distortion">Eradicates Distortion</h3>



<p>No one likes a blurry image or distortion in the edges of the image. This is a very common issue in flat monitors and not so much in curved monitors. Generally, when screen size increases, the distortion also increases.</p>



<p>However, in curved monitors, you are unlikely to face this issue.</p>



<h3 id="h-comfortable">Comfortable</h3>



<p>Since the distortion is low or nil, you will be more comfortable using curved monitors. Your eyes will not experience any strain, and you can play games for long hours. Moreover, even with large screens, a curved monitor will not exceed your field of view.</p>



<p>In flat monitors, you will need to move your head to take in the full screen. This becomes a nuisance after a certain time, which is not a problem in curved gaming monitors.</p>



<h3 id="h-large-field-of-view">Large Field of View</h3>



<p>Like I mentioned in the earlier point, the field of view in curved gaming monitors is better than flat monitors. Both ends of the monitor are curved to ensure that the whole screen stays within your eye range.</p>



<p>You will not have to move your head or eyesight sideways to capture the whole screen. A curved screen ensures that light from all directions is directed to your eye. Hence you do not have to face much ocular exertion.</p>

<p>The Gigabyte G34WQC is a budget-friendly monitor that comes with a 34 inches widescreen. It has a 21:9 aspect ratio that gives you the freedom to play any type of video game and multitask on a single screen.</p>



<p>The combination of 144 Hz refresh rate, 1 ms response time, and low input lag gives you an enhanced gaming experience. This gaming monitor supports FreeSync and is also NVIDIA G-Sync compatible.</p>



<p>At first look, the Gigabyte G34WQC is attractive with a very simple yet stylish design. It has a V-shaped stand along with thin borders to support the monitor. The ultra-widescreen ensures that you can get a better gaming angle.</p>



<p>Since the stand is quite large on the base, it supports the monitor well. You will not find the stand wobbling under the weight of the monitor.</p>



<p>On the bottom part of the stand, you will find a cutout. This helps manage your cables and keep them tangle-free.</p>



<p>You might need to adjust your chair, especially if you are a tall person. The monitor height is lower than most gaming monitors, even when it is at its highest setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two input connectors are present &#8211; HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4. If you connect to HDMI 2.0, your refresh rate will be limited to just 100Hz. For enjoying the maximum refresh rate, you can use the DisplayPort along with Adaptive-Sync.</p>



<h3 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h3>



<p>Overall, the Gigabyte G34WQC is a good 144Hz gaming monitor with a large view and amazing contrast ratio. The monitor is suitable for both single-player games and competitive multiplayer games. However, the brand could work in the ergonomics of the monitor.</p>

<p>At a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz, this gaming monitor ensures that you get a satisfactory display.</p>

<p>The monitor has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, which gives you stellar gaming performance when coupled with the refresh rate. This gaming monitor is compatible with both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Free-Sync technologies that prevent screen tearing.</p>

<p>Another ultra-wide monitor that you would love is the AOC CU34G2X. This monitor offers several amazing features and is designed to give you the best gaming experience.</p>



<p>The AOC CU34G2X has a VA panel and features 300 nits brightness, a 3000:1 contrast ratio, and a color depth of 8-bit. Due to the VA panels, you can enjoy brighter whites and deeper blacks. If you keep the monitor in the darkroom, you can enjoy immersive viewing.</p>



<p>The color accuracy to great; however, it lacks the vibrancy of IPS panels. Hence, it is best not to use the monitor for any color-critical functions. For gaming purposes, this monitor is perfect since it gives you optimum color output.</p>



<p>When it comes to adaptive-sync technology, the monitor ideally supports FreeSync. However, the monitor is also compatible with G-Sync technology. It also has the necessary connectors along with 3.2 USB ports.</p>



<p>The design of the monitor screams gaming with the red trims on the front and back. Some gamers might only find the lack of RGB lighting a little disappointing. However, this is not something that will hinder our gaming experience.</p>

<h3 id="h-conclusion-2">Conclusion</h3>



<p>AOC CU34G2X features an impressive image quality and a widescreen. This is great for competitive multiplayer games since the response time is also very low. Furthermore, the output lag is less, ensuring that your game goes at the same speed as the other players. Even with so many amazing features, the price range of the monitor is quite affordable.</p>

<p>The BenQ EX3203R is a 31.5-inch large-screen monitor which is mainly designed for gaming. Due to the large screen, you can enjoy videos along with playing almost all types of games. The image is color accurate and has high resolution.</p>



<p>With a curvature of 1800R, the screen offers you a good field of view. Due to this curvature, you get a better immersive experience which you will not get on flat screens.</p>



<p>The display of the monitor is very standard and not too fancy. There is a panel that is present inside a gray matte cabinet. The cabinet has bezels at the top and sides, which are almost invisible.</p>



<p>I personally find the BenQ EX3203R display best suitable for Xbox One X and Xbox One S gamers.</p>



<p>BenQ EX3203R features a contrast ratio of 3000:1, which is more than the standard 1000:1 ratio. Due to this, the blacks are much deeper, and you can enjoy brighter tones. The best thing about the monitor (<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gaming-monitors.html">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gaming-monitors.html</a>) is the balanced relation between different tones.</p>



<h3 id="h-conclusion-3">Conclusion</h3>



<p>Overall, the features of the BenQ EX3203R make it ones of the best 144Hz gaming monitors on this list. The monitor offers multiple connectivity options. There is one DisplayPort 1, one mini-DisplayPort 1.2, and one HDMI 2.0.</p>

<p>Asus is a widely known name in the market, and you will get nothing but the best quality monitors. As with other curved gaming monitors, even the Asus ROG Strix XG32VQ offers immersive visual quality. Even though the monitor has some amazing features, the high price point can be a drawback for some people.</p>



<p>The 32 inches curved screen, along with a 144Hz refresh rate, gives you mind-blowing visuals. One thing that you will find in this monitor and not in the other is RGB lighting. This feature makes it a perfect gaming monitor and much different from the other monitors I have reviewed.</p>



<p>The combination of 300 nits brightness, contrast ratio of 3000:1, and SVA balanced the color tone. You will see the blacks much deeper and the whites much brighter.</p>



<p>The Asus ROG Strix XG32VQ gives you multiple gaming features. Some of these gaming features are preset of GameVisual picture and customizable FPS counter, timers, and crosshairs of GamePlus.</p>



<h3 id="h-conclusion-4">Conclusion</h3>



<p>The Asus ROG Strix XG32VQ may be expensive, but it provides high value for money. It is a high-quality gaming monitor which gives you high immersion levels along with fast response time. Moreover, the input lag of the monitor is also very less.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table Specs table table-hover"><table><tbody><tr><td>Panel Type</td><td>VA / W-LED</td></tr><tr><td>Screen Size</td><td>27 inches</td></tr><tr><td>Aspect Ratio</td><td>16: 9</td></tr><tr><td>Curve Radius</td><td>1500 mm</td></tr><tr><td>Response Time</td><td>1 ms</td></tr><tr><td>Video Inputs</td><td>1 x DisplayPort 1.2 / 2 x HDMI 2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Audio Output</td><td>3.5 mm headphones</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>11.9 lbs.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If you are looking for a 144Hz 1440p curved gaming monitor, then the AOC CQ27G2 is the one for you. The VA (Vertical Alignment) panel is a Samsung product coupled with a 3000:1 contrast ratio and 178 degrees viewing angles. The color depth of the monitor is 8 bits, and the brightness is 250 nits.</p>



<p>I feel that the contrast ratio makes the whites brighter and blacks inky.</p>



<p>Even with 250 nits, the monitor is exceptionally bright in normal lighting conditions. You may also have to decrease the brightness like I had to.</p>



<p>Gaming is not the only thing that you can use the monitor for. I felt that the monitor is exceptionally good for high-definition movies. You can also use it for different types of content creation or other functionalities.</p>



<p>The VA panel type may not be good for photo editing since you would do better with an IPS panel.</p>



<p>An interesting thing about the AOC CQ27G2 is the 1ms response time. This response time is perfect for fast-paced multiplayer games. However, there may be slight smearing when you are playing these competitive games.</p>



<h3 id="h-conclusion-5">Conclusion</h3>



<p>At first glance, the AOC CQ27G2 looks like any other standard curved monitor. However, on further exploration, you will be mesmerized by what the monitor has to offer. Ignoring a few slight drawbacks, the AOC CQ27G2 is the best 144Hz monitor that you could opt for.</p>

<p>We cannot underestimate the importance of proper processor cooling, altering the computer&#8217;s performance and stability. It also impacts the amount of PC usage and the possibility of overclocking the processor.</p>



<p>The CPU is highly vulnerable to high temperatures, especially if exposed to them for an extended period. Therefore, throttling or simply lowering CPU power is this component&#8217;s first line of protection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other implications include unreliable system performance, automatic restarts, and, finally, permanent processor damage. As a result, we have to dissipate the created heat somehow, using the CPU coolers.</p>



<p>How To Pick A Cpu Cooler: First and foremost, you must determine the CPU socket on your motherboard. For attaching the CPU cooler, different sockets have different holes. Most coolers, on the whole, feature universal, adjustable systems that allow them to the mounting holes. It is, nonetheless, worth examining for certainty and security.</p>



<p>What else is there to say? First, of course, there&#8217;s the scale. You may find the dimensions of each air cooling in the product specification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth comparing this to the housing dimensions and the maximum height of the cooler that can fit inside such a box. The fact that some memory chips may not fit under the heat sink is also a prevalent issue.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-function-of-a-cpu-cooler">What Is The Function Of A Cpu Cooler?</h2>



<p>The air conditioning system&#8217;s functioning is reasonably straightforward. First, the processor&#8217;s heated core radiates heat to the IHS (so-called caps). The heat sink base catches it, which spreads them across its whole surface. Finally, they aided the heat pipes, which, when filled with a particular liquid or gas, use the convection phenomenon to convey waste heat (matter movement).</p>



<p>The procedure may come to an end here, depending on whether we have passive or active cooling. First, the air circulation cools the heat sink in the housing in passive coolers. Then, in current ones, the use of those fans compelling this movement. Next, even more.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-pick-a-cpu-cooler-what-should-you-look-for-in-a-cooling-fan">How To Pick A Cpu Cooler: What Should You Look For In A Cooling Fan?</h2>



<p>The fan is the most significant aspect of the design, irrespective of whether we select air (active) and water cooling. It is the fan that facilitates heat transfer from the radiator and cooler. So which CPU fan is the most suitable? It&#8217;s essential to pay attention to a few variables here.</p>



<h2 id="h-rotational-size-speed">Rotational Size &amp; Speed</h2>



<p>First and foremost, the size or speed of rotation &#8211; the greater the total flow or, the better the fan efficiency, the greater they are. However, it&#8217;s important to note that higher speeds commonly result in a more significant level of created noise. Therefore, it includes a fan with LED illumination in the CPU cooler for gamers.</p>



<h2 id="h-design-of-the-bearing">Design Of The Bearing</h2>



<p>The bearing utilized has a significant impact on the noise produced and the structure&#8217;s durability. In addition, we should consider the fan&#8217;s connection &#8211; newer models use a 4-pin plug that allows you to manage the rotation speed, for example, from the motherboard.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-it-better-to-use-aluminum-or-copper-as-a-heat-sink">Is It Better To Use Aluminum Or Copper As A Heat Sink?</h2>



<p>We may locate a heat sink for the processor in two variants: aluminum or copper, in both air coolers and water coolers. The first is significantly more common, especially in lower-cost structures. On the other hand, copper heat sinks are not widely used, and they were paired with aluminum heat sinks due to their physical qualities, yet they provide higher performance. However, they are, unfortunately, more expensive than the conventional ones.</p>



<p>The thermal paste is also a significant component of cooling. Therefore, we can employ both types of heat sinks with the most popular mixes.</p>

<h2 id="h-cpu-cooling-active-or-passive">CPU Cooling: Active Or Passive?</h2>



<p>When should active cooling be used, more excellent, and when should passive cooling be used? How To Pick A Cpu Cooler: It all depends on our personal choices for computer work culture:</p>



<p>Using a fan in active coolers, which improves heat dissipation efficiency but also generates noise.</p>



<p>Because passive designs are fanless, they operate in perfect silence. Thus they&#8217;re worth noting if you&#8217;re looking for quiet CPU cooling.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that passive CPU cooling has restricted performance, so they&#8217;ll only function with low-performance standard processors.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-cpu-is-cooler-simple-to-set-up">What CPU Is Cooler Simple To Set Up?</h2>



<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the matter of assembling; the rule of thumb here is that the smaller the item, the easier it is to install.</p>



<p>Because a good CPU cooler is more sophisticated, installation can be more difficult. Installing new cooling can often need removing the entire motherboard from the casing (must screw the CPU cooler mounting brackets from the bottom of the board). If we do not want or cannot disassemble the entire computer, it is worthwhile to pay attention to such criteria. However, this is not a rule because, in most circumstances, you may easily install a home processor cooling system.</p>



<p>Let us discuss in detail the few best CPU coolers available on the market.</p>

<p>A computer&#8217;s hard disc is among the most critical components. It&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find all of your films, images, apps, and necessary software. What Does The Computer Hard Disk Do?. <strong> </strong>The hard drive is the computer&#8217;s permanent memory. It means that even after switching off the computer, all data and programs remain on it. You can measure the capacity of a hard disc in gigabytes. </p>



<p>Any computer would be incomplete without a hard drive. Its kind, capacity, and speed will vary based on whether one will install it on a desktop pc, laptop, and NAS.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-following-are-the-components-of-the-hard-drive">The following are the components of the hard drive:&nbsp;</h2>



<p>1. An electrical outlet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Magnetic discs &#8211; these are discs used to store data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. Connections between the disc and the I/O controller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. A dust-proof gasket.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. Motor for the head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. The head for writing and reading data to and from the disc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>7. Wires that link the heads to the control systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>8. IDE cable &#8211; a type of cable used to connect computers that adhere to the IDE &amp; EIDE standards. It&#8217;s in the style of a wide tape containing extended narrow plugs.</p>



<p>Another feature that distinguishes the hard drive is the continuous data transfer characteristic required to process huge files containing graphics, sound, and movies and burn CD-Rs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The disc should have a consistent data transfer rate of around 10000 KB/sec.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another element is the average data access time. This value controls how rapidly the disc can locate the data necessary on its surface. It is typical to provide information on average access time because quickly finding the specific data and others slowly.</p>



<p>It means that if we have a massive quantity of data split across multiple files, we will waste some time waiting for the disc to find new pieces of data. The fastest disc has an average access time of roughly ten milliseconds.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-hard-disc-should-you-get-and-where-should-you-start-looking-for-one">What Hard Disc Should You Get And Where Should You Start Looking For One? </h2>



<p>This kind of computer work will be the first thing you should ask yourself while selecting a hard drive for your computer. You don&#8217;t need a fast and pricey SSD drive if you only use an office suite or a web browser regularly, as well as movies with a resolution lower than Full HD.</p>



<p>A primary, inexpensive SSD with a bit of capacity will do for less demanding activities, as will a second large HDD for storing more data. Consider a hybrid SSHD or SSD drive if you don&#8217;t have enough space for two purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>a solid-state drive (SSD (flash)&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>SSHD (Hybrid)&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Hard Disk Drive (HDD) (magnetic, disk)</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-ssd">SSD<strong> </strong></h2>



<p>A solid-state drive (SSD) is a storage device that uses Flash memory technology. As a result, they have a faster speed than regular disc drives, but the price per GB of capacity also increases directly. The most expensive and most significant models can hold up to 4 TB of data. 128 GB is the minimum capacity for free operation of Windows and a set of essential apps. However, remember the periodic updates &amp; the need for workspace when purchasing an SSD disc having a capacity of at least 160 or 180GB.</p>



<h2 id="h-hybrid-sshd">Hybrid SSHD </h2>



<p>The SSHD is a hybrid drive that falls somewhere in the middle in terms of speed and pricing. We are obtaining the Efficiency advantages thanks to a small amount of Flash me. The use of HDD disc technology allows you to maintain a large capacity at a reasonable price.</p>



<h2 id="h-hdd">HDD</h2>



<p>Also known as magnetic disc drives, HDDs are older disc drives that provide a large capacity for a low price and slower write and read speed than more recent SSDs. It&#8217;s also worth noting that the HDD is more susceptible to mechanical damage due to its moving mechanical parts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When handled, it is frequently destroying particularly true about external drives, such as dropping onto a hard surface.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-the-capacity-of-your-hard-drive">How Much The Capacity Of Your Hard Drive? </h2>



<p>The critical criteria in determining a laptop/computer hard drive are for utilizing the Device. It&#8217;s important to note that the web browser &amp; text documents only take up a small amount of space.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-hard-disc-in-a-laptop">Hard Disc In A Laptop </h2>



<p>What Does The Computer Hard Disk Do? You could choose the SSD drive with the space of 128 &#8211; 500GB again for the fastest possible pace or even an HDD with a distance of 1TB or more to store significant amounts of information &#8211; such as images, movies, or music &#8211; when purchasing or extending a business notebook.</p>



<h2 id="h-hard-disc-for-the-desktop">Hard Disc For The Desktop </h2>



<p>Almost the exact requirements apply to a desktop computer, except that motherboards have supported at least two hard drives for many years. Combining a fast SSD drive with a less expensive, larger HDD is a popular approach. If we want to save a significant number of Full HD movies from a smartphone, for example, 1 TB of free space is a suitable minimum.</p>



<p>There are many hard disks available online and also in shops. We would discuss a few hard disks available on the market in detail below.</p>

<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts:</h2>



<p>Now you can understand What Does The Computer Hard Disk Do?.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Hard drives dominate because of their low cost, large capacity, &amp; trouble-free functioning. If performance, durability, size, sound, or disintegration were critical aspects of your choices, SSDs are the way to go.</p>



<p>The restricted number of transmitting and receiving cycles with one SSD main memory seems to have been a key stumbling block for SSD technology until recently. Nowadays, the frequency of these cycles surpasses one million, implying that such an SSD&#8217;s lifespan would be several months until it started to exhibit signs of wear and tear.</p>

<p>We are precisely interested in the combination of video cards with the&nbsp;<strong>AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</strong>&nbsp;processor. With this processor, you can even grab a GeForce RTX 3090. Previously, for the Ryzen 5 3600X, the maximum allowed was the RTX 3080. Let&#8217;s discuss over here:</p>

<p>The Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 2060 Super Mini has proven itself as a sound mid-range graphics card in benchmarks. It is almost a complete replacement for the RTX 2070. The card&#8217;s performance is sufficient for gaming, especially in Full HD resolution. At 1440p, the device also performs well, but there is not enough power for Ultra-HD gaming. In the synthetic gaming benchmark 3DMark Fire Strike, the RTX 2060 shows almost identical results to the RTX-2070 models without overclocking and outperforms the stock RTX 2060 by about 10%.</p>



<p>The GeForce RTX 2060 Superbase frequency is now at 1470 MHz (for the RTX 2060 &#8211; 1365 MHz, for the RTX 2070 &#8211; 1410 MHz), and its clock speed is also increased. The Boost frequency is 1650 MHz is lower than the RTX 2060 (1680 MHz) but higher than the RTX 2070 (1620 MHz). However, this does not prevent the RTX 2060 Super from catching up with the RTX 2070 and significantly outperforming the RTX 2060. The card is only 21 centimeters long, making it a good choice for a compact desktop system. The maximum temperature under heavy load was 74 degrees. This makes this model one of the hottest, but the indicators are still within the acceptable range.</p>

<h4 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h4>



<p>Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 2070 Super AMP has an excellent design, both external and in terms of PCB layout, combined with an efficient and, notably, quiet cooling system. Even the backlight is close to ideal, but it is done reasonably, and if necessary, it will be easy to turn it off. In short, Zotac Gaming GeForce RTX 2070 is ideal for those who do not care so much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MSI Suprim X is a series of gaming graphics cards that is now the manufacturer&#8217;s top-end, displacing the Gaming X Trio from the pedestal. We decided to take a closer look at its older representative &#8211; RTX 3090. Our review will tell you about the advantages and disadvantages of this video card<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Recently, the Gaming X Trio line was the oldest among MSI graphics cards. In recent years, faster models have also been released, called Lightning Z, which offered higher performance due to carefully selected components and various improvements. However, MSI has now introduced the new Supreme X line, which is now considered the highest-level &#8211; it includes custom versions of the RTX 3070, 3080 3090&#8230; At the same time, the Gaming X Trio models have not gone anywhere, but they simply turned out to be shifted from the pedestal by the new Supreme X products, which, due to the higher TDP limit in the BIOS, offer higher performance.</p>



<p>Due to the higher power consumption limit and more efficient cooling system, the MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X should be more potent than the corresponding Nvidia Founders Edition. The MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X copes well with any games, except for single projects where the frame counter drops below 60 fps in 4K ( the same Cyberpunk 2077).</p>



<p>The MSI GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X build quality is excellent; it looks and feels like a premium segment. The backplate and the plate covering the cooling system are made of aluminum, although the latter has decorative plastic inserts.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="h-verdict">Verdict</h4>



<p>GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X is the new top-end gaming graphics card from MSI. It requires a lot of power and provides excellent performance but can run into the processor at standard and low resolutions. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is the most powerful gaming graphics card available today. The modified version from MSI &#8211; GeForce RTX 3090 Suprim X &#8211; demonstrated excellent gaming performance.</p>



<p>However, buyers need to understand that top-end performance comes at a price &#8211; in this case, high power consumption. The system itself (without a monitor) required more than 600 watts during operation under load in our tests! The main advantage of the GeForce RTX 3090along with performance, there is a large amount of video memory &#8211; 24 GB. For comparison, the GeForce RTX 3080 has two times less of it, which may become a problem in the future. For comparison, AMD decided not to repeat Nvidia&#8217;s mistakes because its RX 6000 accelerators have 16 GB of video memory.</p>

<p>The TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card is packed with innovative solutions to improve power and cooling. Three powerful Axial-tech fans with durable double ball bearings run under a newly designed metal casing. The RTX 3000 graphics cards received new GPUs. This is one of the most advanced graphics accelerators based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture with support for DirectX 12 Ultimate and real-time ray tracing technology, focused on projects in 4K resolution.</p>



<p>There are no words for these beasts, as the RTX 3080 is one of the most powerful graphics cards, and no other can beat them at their price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The performance of the RTX3080 is excellent, and this graphics card offers twice the performance of its RTX 2080 Ti predecessor, but at half the price. The competitor to this graphics card is the RX 6900 / XT, the best value graphics card, but the RTX 3080 provides the best performance at 1440p. This graphics card can give you triple-digit frame rates at ultra-settings when it comes to 4K gaming.</p>



<p>Another thing that is unique to the Nvidia RTX series graphics card is Ray Tracing and DLSS. With this generation, Nvidia released the second generation RTX, which is much better than before. You can go for the aftermarket ASUS TUF RTX 3080 card, which you perhaps know as one of the best performing and most reliable graphics cards. GeForce RTX 3090 is the most potent 24GB graphics card in the Ampere family, giving you access to Titan-class performance.</p>



<p>The developers address the device not even to the owners of 4K monitors but to gamers who want to enjoy the picture in 8K format. It is essential to remember that 8K panels are even more expensive in retail than GeForce RTX 3090.</p>

<h4 id="h-verdict-1">Verdict</h4>



<p>ASUS TUF GAMING GeForce RTX 3080 O10G is an excellent card that allows you to comfortably play the most current projects with the best graphics and tracing, and for this, you do not need to assemble a new computer from scratch. On the other hand, its cost is still far from even the recommended one, and for this money, you can buy two consoles and even remain on Xbox Game Pass. If you are only planning to assemble a modern PC for the next 5-7 years, then you will need at least another 100 thousand for the rest of the spare parts.</p>



<p>GeForce RTX 3090 is an exciting product positioned as a gaming product (designed for a picture in 8K resolution). Still, it is aimed at enthusiasts (who will conquer ratings in 3DMark with the help of a profile accelerator) and miners (24 GB of memory on one board is a tidbit).</p>



<p>For gamers looking to get the most out of 4K resolution (high fps and detailed picture), we recommend paying attention to the GeForce RTX 3080 because it is a more balanced and entertainment adapter (and also less noisy and colder), which costs at least 30 % cheaper than RTX 3090.</p>

<p>The Radeon RX 5600 XT is a reduced memory version of the Radeon RX 5700 and is essentially a lower clock. Compared with its previous edition, it has the same core GPU configuration and can deliver over a smaller 192-bit bus. The new XFX Thicc II Pro is noticeably shorter and slimmer than the RX 5700. The XFX card runs on the copper cooling plate that solves the issue of low memory temperatures and places additional vents on the edge of the cover.</p>



<p>The RX 5600 XT is rated for 1080p and can handle 1440p with slight degradation. The core is the same as the RX 5700 with 36 Compute Units (CU), 2304 Stream Processors (SP) compared to the 40 CU, and 2560 SP found in the RX 5700 XT. This card is topped off by an attractive metal backplate adorned with the XFX logo, although the cover itself is plastic. It comes with two large axial fans that push hot air into your system. The RX 5600 XT connects through a single 8-pin connector to your power supply, while you will find three DisplayPort for outputs or a single HDMI connection.</p>



<p>XFX offers us here the THICC II PRO, a powerful card whose only flaw is to heat more than the competition. In reality, as we have shown you, it makes sense given its small thickness and the occupation of only two&nbsp;<em>slots</em>. A price currently displayed at 300 euros makes it an excellent choice considering that good air circulation will be necessary within your case.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="h-verdict-2">Verdict:</h4>



<p>XFX offers with this &#8220;THICC II PRO&#8221; series a card with many advantages. The first is, without a doubt, that we are on a model which will not require us to go through the flash box of the bios. You can safely buy this model, which has memory chips clocked at 1750 MHz.</p>



<p>Personally, the design of the card and its sober look won us over. The idea of ​​combining the front fairing and the rear backplate also convinced us and allowed XFX to stand out against the competition. The performances are there, and even if AMD restricts overclocking, we can quickly reach the limits authorized by AMD. Its low thickness is also an asset, resulting in higher temperatures than the other two RX 5600 XTs passed through our hands. A case with good air circulation will reduce and contain temperatures.</p>

<p>Currently, almost all next-gen graphics cards are out of stock on the market, and this is due to wafer shortages and low card production by manufacturers. If you&#8217;re hoping for these graphics cards to stay stable in the market and desire to have your MSRP even at a lower price, you can get the GTX 1660 Ti for your Ryzen 5 5600X. This graphics card is undoubtedly an excellent option for 1080p gaming, and if you can make any compromises with your game settings, you can even go for 1440p.</p>



<p>There are some similar options to this graphics card, too, like the GTX 1070, that you can get on the used market, and that card is good for mid-range gaming, too, even these days. Gigabyte has the best deal on the GTX 1660 Ti, which is better than the founder&#8217;s edition and is almost the same price. This graphics card is factory unlocked, which means you can expect better clock speeds and performance.</p>



<p>The GTX 1660 Ti graphics card comes in a familiar and easily recognizable packaging for most users. Important in the design is the name of the graphics adapter series, the name of the video card line, and the technologies present. The GIGABYTE GTX 1660 Ti GAMING OC graphics card has 6GB of onboard memory and is factory overclocked. This graphics card is very inexpensive, and you will be able to sell it at reasonable prices when you get the current generation graphics card at a regular price.</p>

<h4 id="h-verdict-3">Verdict</h4>



<p>The Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 Ti Gaming OC 6G (6GB) is an excellent option for the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for those who do not need manual overclocking, fancy backlighting, and other excesses inherent in enthusiast products. This is one of the best accelerators for the price segment of 20-25 thousand rubles and all gaming video cards in terms of the ratio of features and prices. Despite the relatively modest positioning, the card has an improved power supply system and slightly increased operating frequencies. A big plus of the Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1660 Ti is a quiet and highly efficient cooling system that does not increase the dimensions of the accelerator (it occupies the standard two slots in the system unit).</p>



<p>With the GeForce GTX, 1660 Ti players get comfort at maximum graphics settings at a resolution of 1920 × 1200 (1080) in all games; some modern games can be played with the same ease at a resolution of 2560 × 1440. The GeForce GTX 1660 Ti is an excellent replacement for the outgoing GeForce GTX 1070, which is more expensive today, and the presence of 6 GB of memory in the GTX 1660 Ti versus 8 GB in the GTX 1070 has practically no effect on performance when it comes to Full HD resolution.</p>

<p>GeForce GTX 1070 comes from the family of NVIDIA graphics processors, with up to 100% more performance than previous series cards and excellent graphic development in virtual reality and video games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Evga GeForce GTX 1070 has a data width of 256 bits, CPU speed 1920 MHz, memory clock speed 80008 MHz, frequency 1594 MHz with a maximum resolution of 7680 x 4320 pixels. It only weighs 1.3 kilograms; it is highly recommended for gaming since its processing speed is genuinely high.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MSI GS66 Stealth<strong>&nbsp;</strong>laptop has an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 graphics accelerator with 16 GB of DDR4-3200 RAM and 16 GB of GDDR6 video memory, which can be independently expanded to 64 GB.</p>



<p>MSI GS66 Stealth Lightweight RTX 3080 laptop weighs 2.1 kg, which is a bit by the standards of gaming models. Its pixel density is 188 PPI, which is enough to avoid seeing ladders in small print. The crystalline effect is also invisible. The brightness of 300 nits is enough for comfortable gaming in a lit room, and the matte finish eliminates reflections and glare under direct light. It is a perfect combination because it comes with a set of ports, a strict design, an excellent display, a valuable battery, a high-quality touchpad, and two slots for SSD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GS66 Stealth&#8217;s design goes against gaming patterns. Such rigor will appeal to those who already have their eyes twitching from the luridness of most gaming laptops. The 15.6-inch screen is made using IPS technology, has a resolution of 2560&#215;1440 and a refresh rate of 240 Hz.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The<strong>&nbsp;</strong>MSI GS66 Stealth Lightweight laptop received three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, HDMI 2.0b, two USB Type C, and 2.5-Gigabit Ethernet. The screen is easy to lift with one hand; the top bezel houses the webcam and faces scanning system. The latter works in the infrared range and recognizes the user even in complete darkness.</p>



<h4 id="h-outcomes">Outcomes</h4>



<p>MSI GS66 Stealth 10UH comes in a top-end filling compact body that grabs the attention of all gamers. The laptop has enough pluses, such as a rich set of ports, an excellent display, a massive battery, a high-quality touchpad, and two slots for SSD. On the other hand, the compactness imposes corresponding restrictions: the cooling system does not allow a powerful video card to work to its fullest (its performance is comparable to the RTX 3070 from thick and heavy laptops). The main complaint is the inexpressive sound. At the same time, the price of new items is not designed for those who are ready to put up with compromises.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, ASUS revamped its ROG gaming laptop lineup with various models for the discerning enthusiast. The manufacturer continues to develop the ROG Strix SCAR series devices, which were initially positioned as solutions for e-sportsmen.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>best RTX 3080 laptop</strong>&nbsp;is enclosed in a black casing; there are no other options. The cover is made of aluminum alloy; the rest of the elements are plastic. There is a large brand logo on the top panel and the ROG lettering in the left corner, which is formed by texture dots. Around the front and sides and under the screen, and in the logo, some LEDs glow in different colors. In theory, the color depends on the keyboard backlight, but if desired, you can customize it yourself in the Aura Creator application.</p>



<p>The device&#8217;s build quality is excellent: the construction is solid, does not bend or twist. The laptop&#8217;s dimensions are typical for a gaming laptop: 354x259x27 mm, the weight is 2.3 kg. The laptop uses a 15.6-inch IPS screen with Full HD resolution and support for Adaptive-Sync. The aspect ratio is 16: 9. The maximum display brightness is 350 cd / m2, which is quite enough for indoor work. The contrast ratio is 1200: 1 &#8211; a good indicator, thanks to which colors look deep, realistic, saturated.</p>



<p>The standard kit also offers a set of documentation, a pair of interchangeable decorative panels, two power supplies (main &#8211; 240 W, additional &#8211; Type-C 100 W), and a wired gaming mouse ROG Chakram Core.</p>



<p>ASUS ROG Strix SCAR 15 G533QM-HF063 laptop comes without an operating system. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor runs at 3.2-4.4 GHz. It has eight cores and is capable of processing 16 data streams simultaneously. The chip is made according to the norms of the 7nm technical process, and it has 16 MB of the cache memory of the third level and 45 watts of power consumption.</p>



<h4 id="h-outcomes-1"><strong>Outcomes:</strong></h4>



<p>ASUS ROG Strix SCAR 15 G533 is a laptop that can be used for everyday life and, of course, for games. Despite the black design, the device is memorable due to LEDs along the perimeter of the case, a catchy logo on the lid, and a translucent keyboard. The laptop is equipped with a 15.6-inch Full HD screen with a refresh rate of 300 Hz, a keyboard with individual RGB-backlit, a large battery, and speakers with good sounding. And the filling in the form of an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics can cope with modern games at maximum settings.</p>

<p>The MSI GE76 Raider follows the same design lines as the MSI GE66 Raider, a departure from last year&#8217;s GE series. Instead of the bright red accents of last year&#8217;s models, the novelty welcomes us with solid matte gray metal surfaces. As for the choice of materials, metal is mainly used in the decoration; thus, the strength of the entire structure has increased, the screen now does not deform or bend.</p>



<p>The GE66 Raider line is geared towards gamers. The reason lies in the powerful hardware, including the new GeForce RTX 30 graphics cards from NVIDIA and other components, including a responsive display and a high-quality case. The latter has become closer to the flagship GT line, with a more aggressive design. For fans of RGB lighting, the 15-inch laptop will not disappoint. Not only is the keyboard backlit, but MSI has also added a separate RGB strip located at the front of the laptop.</p>



<p>At 23mm thick and weighing around 2.3kg, the MSI GE66 Raider laptop is thicker and heavier than trendy thin and light laptops like the recently tested GS66 Stealth. But it remains relatively mobile.</p>



<p>MSI offers the GE76 Raider series with several different display options, including 60 Hz UHD and 240/300 Hz FHD IPS panels.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Today,&nbsp;<strong>best RTX 3080 laptop</strong>&nbsp;has a 300 Hz IPS screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The matrix characteristics are excellent, which only costs a high level of brightness and almost 100% color coverage of the RGB spectrum.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-outcomes-2">Outcomes</h3>



<p>The updated MSI GE67 Raider can be called the pinnacle of the evolution of a classic gaming notebooks. The novelty is cooler, quieter, and faster than last year&#8217;s GE75. This model is designed to provide the user with maximum comfort and productivity at home, but at the same time, not let down when you need to take it somewhere with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gaming performance of the&nbsp;<strong>best RTX 3080 laptop</strong>&nbsp;such as &#8220;MSI GE66 Raider&#8221; is simply excellent; the laptop produces more than 60 fps at maximum settings, in all games without exception at maximum graphics settings in a resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels, and so that gamers can take full advantage of the advantage that a good frame rate gives, MSI has equipped the laptop screen with a frequency of 300 Hz. The only drawback that we managed to find in it is the price. But nobody expected.</p>

<p>The Razer Blade Pro 17 has aesthetics similar to the manufacturer&#8217;s previous models, including the Razer Blade 15 and even the Razer Phone 2, black with a predominance of green stripes. It may not be as efficient as, for example, Alienware gaming laptops, but it makes the laptop look as good in the office as it does at home. Constructed from aluminum, the black laptop case has a matte anodized finish to prevent fingerprints and scratches.</p>



<p>The Blade Pro 17 is not the thinnest laptop on the market &#8211; the name belongs to the non-gaming LG Gram 17 &#8211; but it offers the highest quality gaming and many different ports, which is just as important because you can connect it to your TV, VR hardware, or add accessories.</p>



<p>The Razer Blade Pro 17 has a keyboard that is backlit by Chroma software, allowing you to add custom backlighting to each key. It uses an anti-glare coating but lacks a numeric keypad and macro assignment, which is surprising for a device at this price point.</p>



<p>The Razer Blade Pro has a feature of 17.3-inch LED display in all of its variants. It displays the image in Full HD resolution, that is, 1920 x 1080 pixels, with a refresh rate of 144 Hz. Extremely thin 6mm bezels frame it. Regardless of your graphics card, buy the Blade Pro 17 and get a 9th Gen Intel Core i7-9750H six-core processor. It operates mainly at 2.6 GHz and reaches 4.5 GHz in Max Turbo mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-outcomes-3">Outcomes</h3>



<p>The Razer Blade Pro 17 looks great in design, perfect for all of the manufacturer&#8217;s devices. The 17.3- inch display isn&#8217;t the brightest we&#8217;ve seen, but the 144Hz refresh rate provides complete gaming comfort. It costs more than other gaming laptop but has weaker components. Game performance is very good; ray tracing support and hitting over 60 frames per second at the highest settings allows you to get the best out of games visually, speakers and ports are also very good, but the keyboard could be better thought out.</p>

<p>The Alienware m15 R3 looks almost unchanged when compared to the previous generation of this model. The owners of such laptops will distinguish R3 from R2, perhaps, only by the older version&#8217;s lack of a card reader. The device is equipped with RGB lighting and considered as the best RTX 3080 laptop. The keyboard is illuminated, and the logo, the power button, and the rear panel border. The laptop is only 19.5 mm thick.</p>



<p>&nbsp;It&#8217;s OLED version of the m15 will be slightly thicker, but still, the laptop looks slim and compact. The weight of the computer does not exceed 2.2 kg.
